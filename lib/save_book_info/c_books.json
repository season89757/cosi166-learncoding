[{"isbn":"9781449313043","title":"Practical C Programming","author":"Steve Oualline","publish_date":"1997-08-01","description":"There are lots of introductory C books, but this is the first one that has the no-nonsense, practical approach that has made Nutshell Handbooks® famous.C programming is more than just getting the syntax right. Style and debugging also play a tremendous part in creating programs that run well and are easy to maintain. This book teaches you not only the mechanics of programming, but also describes how to create programs that are easy to read, debug, and update.Practical rules are stressed. For example, there are fifteen precedence rules in C (&& comes before || comes before ?:). The practical programmer reduces these to two: Multiplication and division come before addition and subtraction. Contrary to popular belief, most programmers do not spend most of their time creating code. Most of their time is spent modifying someone else's code. This books shows you how to avoid the all-too-common obfuscated uses of C (and also to recognize these uses when you encounter them in existing programs) and thereby to leave code that the programmer responsible for maintenance does not have to struggle with. Electronic Archaeology, the art of going through someone else's code, is described.This third edition introduces popular Integrated Development Environments on Windows systems, as well as UNIX programming utilities, and features a large statistics-generating program to pull together the concepts and features in the language.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4miO-X83hmUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":456,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4miO-X83hmUC&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":3.5,"ratings_count":11,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4miO-X83hmUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780132781190","title":"Programming in C","author":"Stephen G.

Mastering Algorithms with C offers you a unique combination of theoretical background and working code. With robust solutions for everyday programming tasks, this book avoids the abstract style of most classic data structures and algorithms texts, but still provides all of the information you need to understand the purpose and use of common programming techniques. Implementations, as well as interesting, real-world examples of each data structure and algorithm, are included. Using both a programming style and a writing style that are exceptionally clean, Kyle Loudon shows you how to use such essential data structures as lists, stacks, queues, sets, trees, heaps, priority queues, and graphs. He explains how to use algorithms for sorting, searching, numerical analysis, data compression, data encryption, common graph problems, and computational geometry. And he describes the relative efficiency of all implementations. The compression and encryption chapters not only give you working code for reasonably efficient solutions, they offer explanations of concepts in an approachable manner for people who never have had the time or expertise to study them in depth. Anyone with a basic understanding of the C language can use this book. In order to provide maintainable and extendible code, an extra level of abstraction (such as pointers to functions) is used in examples where appropriate. Understanding that these techniques may be unfamiliar to some programmers, Loudon explains them clearly in the introductory chapters.

Recent studies demonstrate the practical advantages of this approach for solving a diverse array of optimization problems from both classical and real world settings. Scatter search contrasts with other evolutionary procedures, such as genetic algorithms, by providing unifying principles for joining solutions based on generalized path constructions in Euclidean space and by utilizing strategic designs where other approaches resort to randomization. The book's goal is to provide the basic principles and fundamental ideas that will allow the readers to create successful applications of scatter search. The book includes the C source code of the methods introduced in each chapter. From the Foreword: `Scatter Searchrepresents a \"missing link\" in the literature of evolutionary methods... From a historical perspective, the dedicated use of heuristic strategies both to guide the process of combining solutions and to enhance the quality of offspring has been heralded as a key innovation in evolutionary methods, giving rise to what are sometimes called \"hybrid\" or (\"memetic\") evolutionary procedures. The underlying processes have been introduced into the mainstream of evolutionary methods (such as genetic algorithms, for example) by a series of gradual steps beginning in the late 1980s. Yet this theme is an integral part of the scatter search methodology proposed a decade earlier, and the form and scope of such heuristic strategies embedded in scatter search continue to set it apart. Although there are points in common between scatter search and other evolutionary approaches, principally as a result of changes that have brought other approaches closer to scatter search in recent years, there remain differences that have an important impact on practical outcomes. Reflecting this impact, a hallmark of the present book is its focus on practical problem solving. Laguna and Martí give the reader the tools to create scatter search implementations for problems from a wide range of settings. Although theoretical problems (such as abstract problems in graph theory) are included, beyond a doubt the practical realm has a predominant role in this book....'

Dewhurst","publish_date":"2005-02-28","description":"What Every Professional C++ Programmer Needs to Know—Pared to Its Essentials So It Can Be Efficiently and Accurately Absorbed C++ is a large, complex language, and learning it is never entirely easy. But some concepts and techniques must be thoroughly mastered if programmers are ever to do professional-quality work. This book cuts through the technical details to reveal what is commonly understood to be absolutely essential. In one slim volume, Steve Dewhurst distills what he and other experienced managers, trainers, and authors have found to be the most critical knowledge required for successful C++ programming. It doesn’t matter where or when you first learned C++. Before you take another step, use this book as your guide to make sure you’ve got it right! This book is for you if You’re no “dummy,” and you need to get quickly up to speed in intermediate to advanced C++ You’ve had some experience in C++ programming, but reading intermediate and advanced C++ books is slow-going You’ve had an introductory C++ course, but you’ve found that you still can’t follow your colleagues when they’re describing their C++ designs and code You’re an experienced C or Java programmer, but you don’t yet have the experience to develop nuanced C++ code and designs You’re a C++ expert, and you’re looking for an alternative to answering the same questions from your less-experienced colleagues over and over again C++ Common Knowledge covers essential but commonly misunderstood topics in C++ programming and design while filtering out needless complexity in the discussion of each topic. What remains is a clear distillation of the essentials required for production C++ programming, presented in the author’s trademark incisive, engaging style.","publisher":"Pearson Education","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Uemuaza3fTEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":272,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Uemuaza3fTEC&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Uemuaza3fTEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=38&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781878707574","title":"Programming Microcontrollers in C","author":"Ted Van Sickle","publish_date":"2000-12","description":"This practical tutorial reviews the essentials of C programming for microcontrollers and examines in detail the issues faced when writing C code.

Marshall","publish_date":"2010","description":"Developments over the last 20 years have fueled considerable speculation about the future of the book and of reading itself. This book begins with a gloss over the history of electronic books, including the social and technical forces that have shaped their development. The focus then shifts to reading and how we interact with what we read: basic issues such as legibility, annotation, and navigation are examined as aspects of reading that eBooks inherit from their print legacy. Because reading is fundamentally communicative, I also take a closer look at the sociality of reading: how we read in a group and how we share what we read. Studies of reading and eBook use are integrated throughout the book, but Chapter 5 \"goes meta\" to explore how a researcher might go about designing his or her own reading-related studies. No book about eBooks is complete without an explicit discussion of content preparation, i.e., how the electronic book is written. Hence, Chapter 6 delves into the underlying representation of eBooks and efforts to create and apply markup standards to them. This chapter also examines how print genres have made the journey to digital and how some emerging digital genres might be realized as eBooks. Finally, Chapter 7 discusses some beyond-the-book functionality: how can eBook platforms be transformed into portable personal libraries? In the end, my hope is that by the time the reader reaches the end of this book, he or she will feel equipped to perform the next set of studies, write the next set of articles, invent new eBook functionality, or simply engage in a heated argument with the stranger in seat 17C about the future of reading.

Seacord","publish_date":"2005-09-09","description":"\"The security of information systems has not improved at a rate consistent with the growth and sophistication of the attacks being made against them. To address this problem, we must improve the underlying strategies and techniques used to create our systems. Specifically, we must build security in from the start, rather than append it as an afterthought. That's the point of Secure Coding in C and C++. In careful detail, this book shows software developers how to build high-quality systems that are less vulnerable to costly and even catastrophic attack. It's a book that every developer should read before the start of any serious project.\" --Frank Abagnale, author, lecturer, and leading consultant on fraud prevention and secure documents Learn the Root Causes of Software Vulnerabilities and How to Avoid Them Commonly exploited software vulnerabilities are usually caused by avoidable software defects. Having analyzed nearly 18,000 vulnerability reports over the past ten years, the CERT/Coordination Center (CERT/CC) has determined that a relatively small number of root causes account for most of them. This book identifies and explains these causes and shows the steps that can be taken to prevent exploitation. Moreover, this book encourages programmers to adopt security best practices and develop a security mindset that can help protect software from tomorrow's attacks, not just today's. Drawing on the CERT/CC's reports and conclusions, Robert Seacord systematically identifies the program errors most likely to lead to security breaches, shows how they can be exploited, reviews the potential consequences, and presents secure alternatives. Coverage includes technical detail on how to Improve the overall security of any C/C++ application Thwart buffer overflows and stack-smashing attacks that exploit insecure string manipulation logic Avoid vulnerabilities and security flaws resulting from the incorrect use of dynamic memory management functions Eliminate integer-related problems: integer overflows, sign errors, and truncation errors Correctly use formatted output functions without introducing format-string vulnerabilities Avoid I/O vulnerabilities, including race conditions Secure Coding in C and C++ presents hundreds of examples of secure code, insecure code, and exploits, implemented for Windows and Linux. If you're responsible for creating secure C or C++ software--or for keeping it safe--no other book offers you this much detailed, expert assistance.","publisher":"Pearson Education","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jfn1IAN3dvwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":368,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jfn1IAN3dvwC&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jfn1IAN3dvwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=47&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781608070770","title":"OFDMA System Analysis and Design","author":"Samuel C.

This book has taken a bold step forward. It not only presents the theory, it reinforces it with simulations, and then it shows us how to actually use the results in real-time applications. This last step is not a trivial step, and that is why so many books, and courses, present only theory and simulations. With the combined expertise of the three authors of this text...the reader can step into the real-time world of applications with a text that presents an accessible path...\" —Delores M. Etter, Texas Instruments Distinguished Chair in Electrical Engineering and Executive Director, Caruth Institute for Engineering Education, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas, USA Mastering practical application of real-time digital signal processing (DSP) remains one of the most challenging and time-consuming pursuits in the field. It is even more difficult without a resource to bridge the gap between theory and practice. Filling that void, Real-Time Digital Signal Processing from MATLAB® to C with the TMS320C6x DSPs, Second Edition is organized in three sections that cover enduring fundamentals and present practical projects and invaluable appendices. This updated edition gives readers hands-on experience in real-time DSP using a practical, step-by-step framework that also incorporates demonstrations, exercises, and problems, coupled with brief overviews of applicable theory and MATLAB® application. Engineers, educators, and students rely on this book for precise, simplified instruction on use of real-time DSP applications. The book’s software supports the latest high-performance hardware, including the powerful, inexpensive, and versatile OMAP-L138 Experimenter Kit and other development boards. Incorporating readers’ valuable feedback and suggestions, this installment covers additional topics (such as PN sequences) and more advanced real-time DSP projects (including higher-order digital communications projects), making it even more valuable as a learning tool.","publisher":"CRC Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LyZyzdiJS9sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":436,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LyZyzdiJS9sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=60&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781441906069","title":"Embedded Software Development with C","author":"Kai Qian, David Den Haring, Li Cao","publish_date":"2009-07-28","description":"Embedded Software Development With C offers both an effectual reference for professionals and researchers, and a valuable learning tool for students by laying the groundwork for a solid foundation in the hardware and software aspects of embedded systems development.

From restated corporate earnings, to incorrect prices on the web, to the bombing of the Chinese Embassy, the media reports the impact of poor data quality on a daily basis. Every business operation creates or consumes huge quantities of data. If the data are wrong, time, money, and reputation are lost. In today's environment, every leader, every decision maker, every operational manager, every consumer, indeed everyone has a vested interest in data quality. Data Quality: The Field Guide provides the practical guidance needed to start and advance a data quality program. It motivates interest in data quality, describes the most important data quality problems facing the typical organization, and outlines what an organization must do to improve. It consists of 36 short chapters in an easy-to-use field guide format. Each chapter describes a single issue and how to address it. The book begins with sections that describe why leaders, whether CIOs, CFOs, or CEOs, should be concerned with data quality. It explains the pros and cons of approaches for addressing the issue. It explains what those organizations with the best data do. And it lays bare the social issues that prevent organizations from making headway. \"Field tips\" at the end of each chapter summarize the most important points.

Martin","publish_date":"2008-08-01","description":"Even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship . Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer–but only if you work at it. What kind of work will you be doing? You’ll be reading code–lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code, and what’s wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft. Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code–of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code. Readers will come away from this book understanding How to tell the difference between good and bad code How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes How to format code for maximum readability How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic How to unit test and practice test-driven development This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.","publisher":"Pearson Education","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_i6bDeoCQzsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":464,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_i6bDeoCQzsC&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":51,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_i6bDeoCQzsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=63&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781439883631","title":"Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation","author":"Steven C Bell, Michael A Orzen","publish_date":"2013-12-12","description":"Winner of a Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award Information Technology is supposed to enable business performance and innovation, improve service levels, manage change, and maintain quality and stability, all while steadily reducing operating costs.

Many organizations appear willing to spend huge amounts on fixing and altering poorly specified software, but seem unwilling to invest a much smaller amount to get the requirements right in the first place. Mastering the Requirements Process, Second Edition , sets out an industry-proven process for gathering and verifying requirements with an eye toward today's agile development environments. In this total update of the bestselling guide, the authors show how to discover precisely what the customer wants and needs while doing the minimum requirements work according to the project's level of agility.

A CD-ROM with demos, code, compiler, executables, and MATLAB examples has been added to the book. Simplicity and an easy narration style are the hallmarks of the book, which have made its previous seven editions immensely successful. Today's C programmer (still the language of choice in science, engineering, game programming and for handheld devices) has to master the complexities of the language and contend with its usage in environments like Windows, Linux, and for the Internet. Let Us C, Eighth Edition covers these three aspects of C programming and doesn?t assume any programming background. It begins with the basics and steadily builds the pace, so the reader finds it easy to handle more complicated topics later.

The gr- ing perception of the ‘Hardware becoming Soft’ and ‘Software becoming Hard’ with the emergence of the FPGAs has made its impact on both the hardware and software professionals to change their mindset of working in narrow domains. An interdisciplinary field where ‘Hardware meets the Software’ for undertaking se- ingly unfeasible tasks is System on Chip (SoC) which has become the basic pl- form of modern electronic appliances. If it wasn’t for SoCs, we wouldn’t be driving our car with foresight of the traffic congestion before hand using GPS. Without the omnipresence of the SoCs in our every walks of life, the society is wouldn’t have evidenced the rich benefits of the convergence of the technologies such as audio, video, mobile, IPTV just to name a few. The growing expectations of the consumers have placed the field of SoC design at the heart of at variance trends. On one hand there are challenges owing to design complexities with the emergence of the new processors, RTOS, software protocol stacks, buses, while the brutal forces of deep submicron effects such as crosstalk, electromigration, timing closures are challe- ing the design metrics.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=74szgruGW3EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":174,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=74szgruGW3EC&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=74szgruGW3EC&pg=PA83&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=96&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781565291416","title":"Using C/C++","author":"Lee Atkinson, Mark Atkinson","publish_date":"1993-01","description":"An introduction to one of the leading compilers on the market offers readers an accessible yet comprehensive tutorial on these complex but powerful programming languages.

For those learning C pointers are a great source of confusion. Instead of treating pointers as a separate topic, their use is integrated into every feature of C. When you learn functions, you learn how pointers work with functions, when you learn structures you learn pointers to structures, when you learn C++ objects, you learn how pointers are used with objects, when you learn arrays you learn every aspect of using pointers and arrays. Because of their special relationship to pointers, arrays are covered in depth in their own section. While useful for readers with little knowledge of programming, it also covers advanced features of C and C++. Each new feature is explained with simple and increasingly complex examples. Special care is taken to explain in detail the relationship between pointers and arrays.

Clark Jr., J. Bibb Cain","publish_date":"1981-06-30","description":"Error-correction coding is being used on an almost routine basis in most new communication systems. Not only is coding equipment being used to increase the energy efficiency of communication links, but coding ideas are also providing innovative solutions to many related communication problems. Among these are the elimination of intersymbol interference caused by filtering and multipath and the improved demodulation of certain frequency modulated signals by taking advantage of the \"natural\" coding provided by a continuous phase. Although several books and nu merous articles have been written on coding theory, there are still noticeable deficiencies. First, the practical aspects of translating a specific decoding algorithm into actual hardware have been largely ignored. The information that is available is sketchy and is widely dispersed. Second, the information required to evaluate a particular technique under situations that are en countered in practice is available for the most part only in private company reports. This book is aimed at correcting both of these problems. It is written for the design engineer who must build the coding and decoding equipment and for the communication system engineer who must incorporate this equipment into a system. It is also suitable as a senior-level or first-year graduate text for an introductory one-semester course in coding theory. The book U\"Ses a minimum of mathematics and entirely avoids the classical theorem/proof approach that is often seen in coding texts.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bAlhxBF6WYYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":422,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bAlhxBF6WYYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=119&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780198065289","title":"Programming in C","author":"Pradip Dey, Manas Ghosh","publish_date":"2011","description":"Illustrates common library functions with program codes and test cases, highlights possible problem areas, and provides exercises for learning to program in C.","publisher":"Oxford University Press, USA","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p9X8ygAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":547,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":2.5,"ratings_count":2,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p9X8ygAACAAJ&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=120&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780132797146","title":"Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#","author":"Robert C.

Through practical examples, it explains the relationship between business requirements, business process design, and service architecture. By tying the SOA implementation directly to business value, it reveals the key to ongoing success and funding.” —Maja Tibbling, Lead Enterprise Architect, Con-way, Inc. “While there are other books on architecture and the implementation of ESB, SOA, and related technologies, this new book uniquely captures the knowledge and experience of the real world. It shows how you can transform requirements and vision into solid, repeatable, and value-added architectures. I heartily recommend it.” —Mark Wencek, SVP, Consulting Services & Alliances, Ultimo Software Solutions, Inc. In his first book, Succeeding with SOA, Paul Brown explained that if enterprise goals are to be met, business processes and information systems must be designed together as parts of a total architecture. In this second book, Implementing SOA , he guides you through the entire process of designing and developing a successful total architecture at both project and enterprise levels. Drawing on his own extensive experience, he provides best practices for creating services and leveraging them to create robust and flexible SOA solutions. Coverage includes Evolving the enterprise architecture towards an SOA while continuing to deliver business value on a project-by-project basis Understanding the fundamentals of SOA and distributed systems, the dominant architectural issues, and the design patterns for addressing them Understanding the distinct roles of project and enterprise architects and how they must collaborate to create an SOA Understanding the need for a comprehensive total architecture approach that encompasses business processes, people, systems, data, and infrastructure Understanding the strategies and tradeoffs for implementing robust, secure, high-performance, and high-availability solutions Understanding how to incorporate business process management (BPM) and business process monitoring into the enterprise architecture Whether you’re defining an enterprise architecture or delivering individual SOA projects, this book will give you the practical advice you need to get the job done.","publisher":"Addison-Wesley Professional","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3EfZKxJ7OFkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":736,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3EfZKxJ7OFkC&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3EfZKxJ7OFkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=127&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9783540423058","title":"Classification of Nuclear C*-Algebras. Entropy in Operator Algebras","author":"M. Rordam, E. Stormer","publish_date":"2002","description":"to the Encyclopaedia Subseries on Operator Algebras and Non-Commutative Geometry The theory of von Neumann algebras was initiated in a series of papers by Murray and von Neumann in the 1930's and 1940's. A von Neumann algebra is a self-adjoint unital subalgebra M of the algebra of bounded operators of a Hilbert space which is closed in the weak operator topology. According to von Neumann's bicommutant theorem, M is closed in the weak operator topology if and only if it is equal to the commutant of its commutant. Afactor is a von Neumann algebra with trivial centre and the work of Murray and von Neumann contained a reduction of all von Neumann algebras to factors and a classification of factors into types I, II and III. C* -algebras are self-adjoint operator algebras on Hilbert space which are closed in the norm topology. Their study was begun in the work of Gelfand and Naimark who showed that such algebras can be characterized abstractly as involutive Banach algebras, satisfying an algebraic relation connecting the norm and the involution. They also obtained the fundamental result that a commutative unital C* -algebra is isomorphic to the algebra of complex valued continuous functions on a compact space - its spectrum. Since then the subject of operator algebras has evolved into a huge mathematical endeavour interacting with almost every branch of mathematics and several areas of theoretical physics.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=--q6jVOeL_kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":198,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=--q6jVOeL_kC&pg=PA5&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=128&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780672325892","title":"C#Builder Kick Start","author":"Joseph Mayo","publish_date":"2004","description":"C#Builder Kick Start provides a rapid overview of the C#Builder tool, a Borland developer¿s introduction to C# explaining the new forms and interfaces, and set of examples illustrating the power of C#, C#Builder, and .NET development.

Bradley","publish_date":"2011-10-25","description":"To learn to program is to be initiated into an entirely new way of thinking about engineering, mathematics, and the world in general. Computation is integral to all modern engineering disciplines, so the better you are at programming, the better you will be in your chosen field. The author departs radically from the typical presentation by teaching concepts and techniques in a rigorous manner rather than listing how to use libraries and functions. He presents pointers in the very first chapter as part of the development of a computational model that facilitates an ab initio presentation of subjects such as function calls, call-by-reference, arrays, the stack, and the heap. The model also allows students to practice the essential skill of memory manipulation throughout the entire course rather than just at the end. As a result, this textbook goes further than is typical for a one-semester course -- abstract data types and linked lists, for example, are covered in depth. The computational model will also serve students in their adventures with programming beyond the course: instead of falling back on rules, they can think through the model to decide how a new programming concept fits with what they already know. The book is appropriate for undergraduate students of engineering and computer science, and graduate students of other disciplines. It contains many exercises integrated into the main text, and the author has made the source code available online.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VK5IjCNA7R8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":238,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VK5IjCNA7R8C&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VK5IjCNA7R8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=140&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"Writing DOS device drivers in C","author":"Phillip M.

Mozer, David E. Rumelhart","publish_date":"1996","description":"Recent years have seen an explosion of new mathematical results on learning and processing in neural networks. This body of results rests on a breadth of mathematical background which even few specialists possess. In a format intermediate between a textbook and a collection of research articles, this book has been assembled to present a sample of these results, and to fill in the necessary background, in such areas as computability theory, computational complexity theory, the theory of analog computation, stochastic processes, dynamical systems, control theory, time-series analysis, Bayesian analysis, regularization theory, information theory, computational learning theory, and mathematical statistics. Mathematical models of neural networks display an amazing richness and diversity. Neural networks can be formally modeled as computational systems, as physical or dynamical systems, and as statistical analyzers. Within each of these three broad perspectives, there are a number of particular approaches. For each of 16 particular mathematical perspectives on neural networks, the contributing authors provide introductions to the background mathematics, and address questions such as: * Exactly what mathematical systems are used to model neural networks from the given perspective? * What formal questions about neural networks can then be addressed? * What are typical results that can be obtained? and * What are the outstanding open problems? A distinctive feature of this volume is that for each perspective presented in one of the contributed chapters, the first editor has provided a moderately detailed summary of the formal results and the requisite mathematical concepts. These summaries are presented in four chapters that tie together the 16 contributed chapters: three develop a coherent view of the three general perspectives -- computational, dynamical, and statistical; the other assembles these three perspectives into a unified overview of the neural networks field.","publisher":"Psychology Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M4kvOztfa6cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":862,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M4kvOztfa6cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=143&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781848000179","title":"Value-Range Analysis of C Programs: Towards Proving the Absence of Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities","author":"Axel Simon","publish_date":"2010-03-10","description":"Abu?erover?owoccurswheninputiswrittenintoamemorybu?erthatisnot large enough to hold the input.

Buttazzo","publish_date":"1997","description":"Real-time computing plays a crucial role in our society since an increasing num­ ber of complex systems rely, in part or completely, on processor control. Ex­ amples of applications that require real-time computing include nuclear power plants, railway switching systems, automotive electronics, air traffic control, telecommunications, robotics, and military systems. In spite of this large application domain, most of the current real-time systems are still designed and implemented using low-level programming and empirical techniques, without the support of a scientific methodology. This approach results in a lack of reliability, which in critical applications may cause serious environmental damage or even loss of life. This book is a basic treatise on real-time computing, with particular emphasis on predictable scheduling algorithms. The main objectives of the book are to introduce the basic concepts of real-time computing, illustrate the most sig­ nificant results in the field, and provide the basic methodologies for designing predictable computing systems useful in supporting critical control applica­ tions. The book is written for instructional use and is organized to enable readers without a strong knowledge of the subject matter to quickly grasp the material. Technical concepts are clearly defined at the beginning of each chapter, and algorithm descriptions are reinforced through concrete examples, illustrations, and tables.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NlfPRUGg9LUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":379,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NlfPRUGg9LUC&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NlfPRUGg9LUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=152&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"C wizard's programming reference","author":"W.

In spite of its long history, this robust database suffers from a lack of easy-to-use documentation. Practical PostgreSQL fills that void with a fast-paced guide to installation, configuration, and usage. This comprehensive new volume shows you how to compile PostgreSQL from source, create a database, and configure PostgreSQL to accept client-server connections. It also covers the many advanced features, such as transactions, versioning, replication, and referential integrity that enable developers and DBAs to use PostgreSQL for serious business applications. The thorough introduction to PostgreSQL's PL/pgSQL programming language explains how you can use this very useful but under-documented feature to develop stored procedures and triggers. The book includes a complete command reference, and database administrators will appreciate the chapters on user management, database maintenance, and backup & recovery. With Practical PostgreSQL, you will discover quickly why this open source database is such a great open source alternative to proprietary products from Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=52ENWgsOWLUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":640,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=52ENWgsOWLUC&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=52ENWgsOWLUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=158&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780521877527","title":"Computability and Logic","author":"George S.

Experiments are valuable tools for all software engineers who are involved in evaluating and choosing between different methods, techniques, languages and tools. The purpose of Experimentation in Software Engineering is to introduce students, teachers, researchers, and practitioners to empirical studies in software engineering, using controlled experiments. The introduction to experimentation is provided through a process perspective, and the focus is on the steps that we have to go through to perform an experiment. The book is divided into three parts. The first part provides a background of theories and methods used in experimentation. Part II then devotes one chapter to each of the five experiment steps: scoping, planning, execution, analysis, and result presentation. Part III completes the presentation with two examples. Assignments and statistical material are provided in appendixes. Overall the book provides indispensable information regarding empirical studies in particular for experiments, but also for case studies, systematic literature reviews, and surveys. It is a revision of the authors’ book, which was published in 2000. In addition, substantial new material, e.g. concerning systematic literature reviews and case study research, is introduced. The book is self-contained and it is suitable as a course book in undergraduate or graduate studies where the need for empirical studies in software engineering is stressed.

In such cases, designers devise mechanisms and architectures that allow the system to either completely mask the effects of a component failure or recover from it so quickly that the application is not seriously affected. This is the work of fault-tolerant designers and their work is increasingly important and complex not only because of the increasing number of “mission critical applications, but also because the diminishing reliability of hardware means that even systems for non-critical applications will need to be designed with fault-tolerance in mind. Reflecting the real-world challenges faced by designers of these systems, this book addresses fault tolerance design with a systems approach to both hardware and software. No other text on the market takes this approach, nor offers the comprehensive and up-to-date treatment Koren and Krishna provide. Students, designers and architects of high performance processors will value this comprehensive overview of the field. * The first book on fault tolerance design with a systems approach * Comprehensive coverage of both hardware and software fault tolerance, as well as information and time redundancy * Incorporated case studies highlight six different computer systems with fault-tolerance techniques implemented in their design * Available to lecturers is a complete ancillary package including online solutions manual for instructors and PowerPoint slides","publisher":"Morgan Kaufmann","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o_Pjbo4Wvp8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":400,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o_Pjbo4Wvp8C&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o_Pjbo4Wvp8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=183&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781599940786","title":"SAS for Mixed Models, Second Edition","author":"Ramon C.

Noteworthy among its many changes is the emergence of the \"Unified Modeling Language\" (UML) as an industry standard. While thousands of software computer professionals and students continue to rely upon the bestselling first edition of Software Testing, the time has come to bring it up to date. Thoroughly revised, the second edition of Software Testing: A Craftsman's Approach reflects the recent growth and changes in software standards and development. Outdated material has been deleted and new topics, figures, case studies now complement its solid, accessible treatment of the mathematics and techniques of software testing. Foremost among this edition's refinements is the definition of a generalized pseudocode that replaces the outdated Pascal code used in the examples. The text is now independent of any particular programming language. The author has also added five chapters on object-oriented testing, incorporated object-oriented versions of two earlier examples, and used them in the chapter on object-oriented testing, which he completely revised with regard to UML. In addition, GUI testing receives full treatment. The new edition of Software Testing provides a comprehensive synthesis of the fundamentals, approaches, and methods that form the basis of the craft. Mastering its contents will allow practitioners to make well-informed choices, develop creative solutions, and ultimately derive the sense of pride and pleasure that a true craftsperson realizes from a job well done.","publisher":"CRC Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yph_AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":359,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":3.5,"ratings_count":4,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Yph_AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=187&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9783540563280","title":"C-XSC: A C++ Class Library for Extended Scientific Computing","author":"Rudi Klatte, Christian Lawo, Ulrich Kulisch, Andreas Wiethoff, Michael Rauch","publish_date":"1993-04-23","description":"C-XSC is a tool for the development of numerical algorithms delivering highly accurate and automatically verified results.

To understand the computer, the authors introduce the LC-3 and provide the LC-3 Simulator to give students hands-on access for testing what they learn. To develop their understanding of programming and programming methodology, they use the C programming language. The book takes a \"motivated\" bottom-up approach, where the students first get exposed to the big picture and then start at the bottom and build their knowledge bottom-up. Within each smaller unit, the same motivated bottom-up approach is followed. Every step of the way, students learn new things, building on what they already know. The authors feel that this approach encourages deeper understanding and downplays the need for memorizing. Students develop a greater breadth of understanding, since they see how the various parts of the computer fit together.","publisher":"McGraw-Hill Professional","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UCLsLFaZ6ZkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":632,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":7,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UCLsLFaZ6ZkC&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=196&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781483265599","title":"Advanced Turbo C Programming","author":"Keith Weiskamp","publish_date":"2014-05-10","description":"Advanced Turbo C Programming provides the necessary programming tools for programmers who are interested in learning new skills in developing some useful tools and PC applications using the Turbo C Version 1.5 programming language and environment.

Russ","publish_date":"2011-04-07","description":"Whether obtained by microscopes, space probes, or the human eye, the same basic tools can be applied to acquire, process, and analyze the data contained in images. Ideal for self study, The Image Processing Handbook, Sixth Edition, first published in 1992, raises the bar once again as the gold-standard reference on this subject. Using extensive new illustrations and diagrams, it offers a logically organized exploration of the important relationship between 2D images and the 3D structures they reveal. Provides Hundreds of Visual Examples in FULL COLOR! The author focuses on helping readers visualize and compare processing and measurement operations and how they are typically combined in fields ranging from microscopy and astronomy to real-world scientific, industrial, and forensic applications. Presenting methods in the order in which they would be applied in a typical workflow—from acquisition to interpretation—this book compares a wide range of algorithms used to: Improve the appearance, printing, and transmission of an image Prepare images for measurement of the features and structures they reveal Isolate objects and structures, and measure their size, shape, color, and position Correct defects and deal with limitations in images Enhance visual content and interpretation of details This handbook avoids dense mathematics, instead using new practical examples that better convey essential principles of image processing. This approach is more useful to develop readers’ grasp of how and why to apply processing techniques and ultimately process the mathematical foundations behind them. Much more than just an arbitrary collection of algorithms, this is the rare book that goes beyond mere image improvement, presenting a wide range of powerful example images that illustrate techniques involved in color processing and enhancement. Applying his 50-year experience as a scientist, educator, and industrial consultant, John Russ offers the benefit of his image processing expertise for fields ranging from astronomy and biomedical research to food science and forensics. His valuable insights and guidance continue to make this handbook a must-have reference.","publisher":"CRC Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gxXXRJWfEsoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":885,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gxXXRJWfEsoC&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gxXXRJWfEsoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=199&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780134044798","title":"Swift Translation Guide for Objective-C: Develop and Design","author":"Maurice Kelly","publish_date":"2014-12-01","description":"APPLE DESIGNED SWIFT SO YOU wouldn’t need previous Apple programming experience, but many Apple developers will want to take advantage of Swift in existing projects—as well as start writing projects from scratch.

It is a core component of our secure development lifecycle. The coding standard described in this book breaks down complex software security topics into easy-to-follow rules with excellent real-world examples. It is an essential reference for any developer who wishes to write secure and resilient software in C and C++.” —Edward D. Paradise, vice president, engineering, threat response, intelligence, and development, Cisco Systems Secure programming in C can be more difficult than even many experienced programmers realize. To help programmers write more secure code, The CERT® C Coding Standard, Second Edition, fully documents the second official release of the CERT standard for secure coding in C. The rules laid forth in this new edition will help ensure that programmers’ code fully complies with the new C11 standard; it also addresses earlier versions, including C99. The new standard itemizes those coding errors that are the root causes of current software vulnerabilities in C, prioritizing them by severity, likelihood of exploitation, and remediation costs. Each of the text’s 98 guidelines includes examples of insecure code as well as secure, C11-conforming, alternative implementations. If uniformly applied, these guidelines will eliminate critical coding errors that lead to buffer overflows, format-string vulnerabilities, integer overflow, and other common vulnerabilities. This book reflects numerous experts’ contributions to the open development and review of the rules and recommendations that comprise this standard.

Whether you're learning French, Java, or C, at some point you'll set aside the tutorial and attempt to converse on your own. It's not necessary to know every subtle facet of French in order to speak it well, especially if there's a good dictionary available. Likewise, C programmers don't need to memorize every detail of C in order to write good programs. What they need instead is a reliable, comprehensive reference that they can keep nearby. C in a Nutshell is that reference. This long-awaited book is a complete reference to the C programming language and C runtime library. Its purpose is to serve as a convenient, reliable companion in your day-to-day work as a C programmer. C in a Nutshell covers virtually everything you need to program in C, describing all the elements of the language and illustrating their use with numerous examples. The book is divided into three distinct parts. The first part is a fast-paced description, reminiscent of the classic Kernighan & Ritchie text on which many C programmers cut their teeth. It focuses specifically on the C language and preprocessor directives, including extensions introduced to the ANSI standard in 1999. These topics and others are covered: Numeric constants Implicit and explicit type conversions Expressions and operators Functions Fixed-length and variable-length arrays Pointers Dynamic memory management Input and output The second part of the book is a comprehensive reference to the C runtime library; it includes an overview of the contents of the standard headers and a description of each standard library function. Part III provides the necessary knowledge of the C programmer's basic tools: the compiler, the make utility, and the debugger. The tools described here are those in the GNU software collection. C in a Nutshell is the perfect companion to K&R, and destined to be the most reached-for reference on your desk.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4Mfe4sAMFUYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":622,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":12,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4Mfe4sAMFUYC&pg=PT528&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=243&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"Advanced Turbo C","author":"Herbert Schildt","publish_date":"1989-01-01","description":"This second edition has now been revised to include Turbo C 1.5 and 2.0, and will prepare the user for power programming.

Advanced C and C++ Compiling explains the build process in detail and shows how to integrate code from other developers in the form of deployed libraries as well as how to resolve issues and potential mismatches between your own and external code trees. With the proliferation of open source, understanding these issues is increasingly the responsibility of the individual programmer.

The first chapter develops potential theory with respect to a single kernel (or discrete time semigroup). All the essential ideas of the theory are presented: excessive functions, reductions, sweeping, maximum principle. The second chapter begins with a study of the notion of reduction in the most general situation possible - the ``gambling house'' of Dubins and Savage. The beautiful results presented have never been made accessible to a wide public. These are then connected with the theory of sweeping with respect to a cone of continuous functions, and the integral representation in compact convex sets. The third chapter presents new or little-known results, with the aim of illustrating the effectiveness of capacitary methods in the most varied fields. The last two chapters are concerned with the theory of resolvents.

Meyer, Director of Architecture Services and R&D, Citi TIBCO’s product suite comprises a diverse range of components. Each component is specialized for a particular functionality, ranging from basic messaging through services, service orchestration, the management of complex business processes, managing master data across multiple systems, and the interpretation ofmassive streams of events (complex event processing). The architecture series from TIBCO® Press comprises a coordinated set of books for software architects and developers, showing how to combine TIBCO components to design and build real-world solutions. TIBCO® Architecture Fundamentals is the core book for understanding and using the TIBCO product suite. It focuses on the TIBCO ActiveMatrix® product suite and a handful of the other most commonly used components, including the TIBCO Enterprise Message ServiceTM and TIBCO BusinessEventsTM. The book provides a sound basis for applying TIBCO products to solve the most common integration and SOA challenges faced by architects and developers. In addition, it lays the foundation for the more advanced books to be added to the architecture series. Designed to make the material as accessible as possible, the book starts with concrete problems architects and developers face every day, showing how to solve these problems with combinations of TIBCO (and selected third-party) products. In the context of specific design scenarios, it also discusses key concepts and decision trade-offs. To accomplish its practical aims, the book Provides useful techniques for discussing and documenting architectures Presents reference architectures (design patterns) for solving common SOA and system integration problems Describes each problem and solution from both business process and technical perspectives Supplies an overview of the typical solution roles played by different TIBCO products The book largely avoids the code-level detail already available in the product manuals, concentrating instead on blueprints for solving whole classes of problems.","publisher":"Addison-Wesley","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z_i9ItVBh5YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":288,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z_i9ItVBh5YC&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z_i9ItVBh5YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=278&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781842651964","title":"Optimization: Theory and Practice","author":"Mohan C.

The goal is to help programmers in wielding the full potential of pointers. In spite of its vast usage, understanding and proper usage of pointers remains a significant problem. This book’s aim is to first introduce the basic building blocks such as elaborate details about memory, the compilation process (parsing/preprocessing/assembler/object code generation), the runtime memory organization of an executable and virtual memory. These basic building blocks will help both beginners and advanced readers to grasp the notion of pointers very easily and clearly. The book is enriched with several illustrations, pictorial examples, and code from different contexts (Device driver code snippets, algorithm, and data structures code where pointers are used).

A selective mailing list system is used to illustrate rapid access to and rearrangement of information selected by criteria specified at runtime. Comprised of eight chapters, this book begins by discussing factors to consider when deciding whether a program needs optimization. In the next chapter, a supermarket price lookup system is used to illustrate how to save storage by using a restricted character set and how to speed up access to records with the aid of hash coding and caching. Attention is paid to rapid retrieval of prices. A selective mailing list system is then used to illustrate rapid access to and rearrangement of information selected by criteria specified at runtime. The book also considers the Huffman coding and arithmetic coding methods of data compression; a token-threaded interpreter whose code can run faster than equivalent compiled C code, due to its greater code density; a customer database program with variable-length records; and index and key access to variable-length records. The final chapter summarizes the characteristics of the algorithms encountered in previous chapters, as well as the future of the art of optimization.

The majority of both Unix and Linux code is still written at the system level, and Linux System Programming focuses on everything above the kernel, where applications such as Apache, bash, cp, vim, Emacs, gcc, gdb, glibc, ls, mv, and X exist. Written primarily for engineers looking to program (better) at the low level, this book is an ideal teaching tool for any programmer. Even with the trend toward high-level development, either through web software (such as PHP) or managed code (C#), someone still has to write the PHP interpreter and the C# virtual machine. Linux System Programming gives you an understanding of core internals that makes for better code, no matter where it appears in the stack. Debugging high-level code often requires you to understand the system calls and kernel behavior of your operating system, too. Key topics include: An overview of Linux, the kernel, the C library, and the C compiler Reading from and writing to files, along with other basic file I/O operations, including how the Linux kernel implements and manages file I/O Buffer size management, including the Standard I/O library Advanced I/O interfaces, memory mappings, and optimization techniques The family of system calls for basic process management Advanced process management, including real-time processes File and directories-creating, moving, copying, deleting, and managing them Memory management -- interfaces for allocating memory, managing the memory youhave, and optimizing your memory access Signals and their role on a Unix system, plus basic and advanced signal interfaces Time, sleeping, and clock management, starting with the basics and continuing through POSIX clocks and high resolution timers With Linux System Programming, you will be able to take an in-depth look at Linux from both a theoretical and an applied perspective as you cover a wide range of programming topics.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=k_ocKY0iegsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":392,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":4.5,"ratings_count":15,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k_ocKY0iegsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=334&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780596002886","title":"Java NIO \\c Ron Hitchens","author":"Ron Hitchens","publish_date":"2002-08-27","description":"The java New I/O (NIO) packages in J2SE 1.4 introduce many new, indispensable features previously unavailable to Java programmers. These include APIs for high-performance I/O operations, regular expression processing, and character set coding. These new libraries are a treasure trove for java developers. The NIO APIs are especially valuable where high-performance I/O is a requirement, but they can also be useful in a wide range of scenarios. The new APIs let you work directly with I/O buffers, multiplex nonblocking streams, do scattering reads and gathering writes, do channel-to-channel transfers, work with memory-mapped files, manage file locks, and much more. The new high-performance Regular Expression Library provides sophisticated, Perl-like regex-processing features such as pattern matching, search and replace, capture groups, look ahead assertions, and many others. The Charset API gives you complete control over character set encoding and decoding, which are vital for properly managing the exchange of documents on the Web, for localization, or for other purposes. You can also create and install your own custom character sets. Staying current with the latent java technology is never easy. NIO, new in Java 1.4, is quite possibly the most important new java feature since Swing. Understanding it thoroughly is essential for any serious Java developer. NIO closes the gap between java and natively compiled languages and enables java applications to achieve maximum I/O performance by effectively leveraging operating-system services in a portable way. Java NIO is a comprehensive guide to the java New I/O facilities. It lots you take full advantage of NIO features and shows you how they work, what they can do for you, and when you should use them. This book brings you up to speed on NIO and shows you how to bring your I/O-bound Java applications up to speed as well. Java NIO is an essential part of any Java professional's library.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z7TQ8NSooS4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":282,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":3.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z7TQ8NSooS4C&pg=PT216&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=335&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780735642461","title":"Windows® via C/C++","author":"Christophe Nasarre, Jeffrey Richter","publish_date":"2007-11-28","description":"Master the intricacies of application development with unmanaged C++ code—straight from the experts.

More specifically it is for all engineers, engineering managers, entrepreneurs, and intrapreneurs. Although engineers are responsible for identifying products and businesses that might benefit their company, all too often their suggestions are rejected. The products don’t fit within the current business, or they threaten the status quo. Thus, start-up companies are the main arena for innovation.Entrepreneurs who are considering starting up a company, or who are already doing so, can use this book to determine the health of their venture. With High-Tech Ventures they can systematically assess the exact stages of their company’s growth. They can compare their experiences to an ideal model, and sidestep--or eliminate--flaws early enough to save time, money, and even the company itself.High-Tech Ventures provides entrepreneurs with insight into the problems they may face, as well as a formal checklist for measuring success. It is also useful for board members, investors, and service industry personnel who are intimately involved in ventures. Professionals such as attorneys, accountants, technical consultants, and marketing consultants, who support the venture’s infrastructure will also find critical information here.High-Tech Ventures includes revealing case studies from major entrepreneurial players such as Sun Microsystems, Apollo, Prime, Amdahl, Cullinet, etc.","publisher":"Basic Books","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Xu8-tvVGhtAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":387,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xu8-tvVGhtAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=351&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781568840734","title":"Type and learn C","author":"Tom Swan","publish_date":"1994-03","description":"This hands-on, fast-paced tutorial makes a potentially tedious subject interesting and fun to learn.

Since the inception of this standard some 20 years ago, it has become the driving force behind the entire imaging workfow. DICOM truly controls all parts of digital image acquisition, transfer and interpretation, and many rad- ologists and other imaging specialists and users may not realize to what extent their work relies on DICOM capabilities. We depend on DICOM extensively. We use DICOM to collect the ori- nal medical images. Tis process is much more complex compared to X-Ray flm, but is also more accurate and complete. We use DICOM to send, d- tribute, and store images, irrespective of machine, manufacturer, or modality. DICOM controls proper image display, and without DICOM we wouldn’t have any image postprocessing – be it simple multiplanar reconstruction, or more advanced perfusion analysis, virtual colonoscopy, volume segmentation, or computer-aided diagnosis. We owe to DICOM much of the ease and fexibility that we enjoy in our work.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tFgSRghUzGsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":384,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tFgSRghUzGsC&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":9,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tFgSRghUzGsC&pg=PA166&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=365&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781574440744","title":"Supply Chain Management: The Basics and Beyond","author":"William C.

Edwards, Daniel C. Goodrich","publish_date":"2012-09-26","description":"Transportation is the lifeline of any nation, connecting people, supporting the economy, and facilitating the delivery of vital goods and services. The 9/11 attacks—and other attacks on surface transportation assets, including the bombings in Madrid, London, Moscow, and Mumbai—demonstrate the vulnerability of the open systems to disruption and the consequences of the attacks on people, property, and the economy. Now more than ever, it has become imperative for businesses operating in the transportation and transit sectors to develop comprehensive security programs accounting for both natural and man-made hazards and safeguarding people, places, and equipment—while at the same time ensuring operations continuity. Providing transportation managers with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to effectively manage the security of transportation assets, Introduction to Transportation Security examines: Basic theories of security and emergency management The integrated nature of the nation’s critical infrastructure and the threats to transportation in each surface mode Federal agencies working in emergency management and transportation security and their intelligence and response requirements and capabilities The types of disasters that have occurred in the U.S. and selected nations, and their significant economic impacts Cost-beneficial security strategies aimed at preventing catastrophic failures in each transportation mode Effective methods for organizing, testing, and evaluating transportation security across modes and professions The book covers all transportation modes and their interconnectivity—including highway, air cargo, freight and passenger rail, transit, and maritime. It presents learning objectives and discussion questions to test assimilation of the material and case studies to facilitate a practical understanding of the concepts. Introduction to Transportation Security provides essential information for students in transportation management programs and professionals charged with safeguarding the movement of assets within our interconnected transportation network.","publisher":"CRC Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qJ1mNZl-SPcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":388,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qJ1mNZl-SPcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=368&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"The Pocket Handbook of Image Processing Algorithms in C","author":"Harley R.

Hay","publish_date":"2006-06-23","description":"In recent years, companies and government agencies have come to realize that the data they use represent a significant corporate resource, whose cost calls for management every bit as rigorous as the management of human resources, money, and capital equipment. With this realization has come recognition of the importance to integrate the data that has traditionally only been available from disparate sources. An important component of this integration is the management of the “metadata” that describe, catalogue, and provide access to the various forms of underlying business data. The “metadata repository” is essential keeping track both of the various physical components of these systems, but also their semantics. What do we mean by “customer?” Where can we find information about our customers? After years of building enterprise models for the oil, pharmaceutical, banking, and other industries, Dave Hay has here not only developed a conceptual model of such a metadata repository, he has in fact created a true enterprise data model of the information technology industry itself. - The book is comprehensive, in that it is based on the Zachman Framework for information architecture--encompassing the Business Owner's, Architect's, and Designer's views, for all columns (data, activities, locations, people, timing, and motivation). - The book is comprehensible, in that it provides a step-by-step description of model and is organized so that different readers can benefit from different parts;. - The book takes advantage of the author's vast experience modeling various other industries; - The model provides a view of the world being addressed by all the techniques, methods and tools of the information processing industry (for example, object-oriented design, CASE, business process re-engineering, etc.). - Indeed it presents many concepts that are not currently being addressed by such tools--and should be. David C. Hay is founder of Essential Strategies, Inc., a consulting firm dedicated to helping clients define corporate information architecture, identify requirements, and plan strategies for the implementation of new systems, including data warehouses. A pioneer in the use of standard data models for standard business situations, he is the author of the book Data Model Patterns: Conventions of Thought. Taking advantage of thirty years' experience helping companies identify systems requirements, he is also the author of Requirements Analysis: From Business Views to Architecture. He is a member of DAMA International and the Oracle Development Tools User Group, and has spoken frequently at events sponsored by these groups and others. - The book is comprehensive, in that it is based on the Zachman Framework for information architecture--encompassing the Business Owner's, Architect's, and Designer's views, for all columns (data, activities, locations, people, timing, and motivation). - The book is comprehensible, in that it provides a step-by-step description of model and is organized so that different readers can benefit from different parts;. - The book takes advantage of the author's vast experience modeling various other industries; - The model provides a view of the world being addressed by all the techniques, methods and tools of the information processing industry (for example, object-oriented design, CASE, business process re-engineering, etc.). - Indeed it presents many concepts that are not currently being addressed by such tools--and should be.","publisher":"Morgan Kaufmann Pub","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pVGRFb1eqvgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":406,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":3.0,"ratings_count":2,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pVGRFb1eqvgC&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=375&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781491908426","title":"Effective Modern C++: 42 Specific Ways to Improve Your Use of C++11 and C++14","author":"Scott Meyers","publish_date":"2014-11-11","description":"Coming to grips with C++11 and C++14 is more than a matter of familiarizing yourself with the features they introduce (e.g., auto type declarations, move semantics, lambda expressions, and concurrency support).

It describes how to write truly great software using C++11 and C++14—i.e. using modern C++. Topics include: The pros and cons of braced initialization, noexcept specifications, perfect forwarding, and smart pointer make functions The relationships among std::move, std::forward, rvalue references, and universal references Techniques for writing clear, correct, effective lambda expressions How std::atomic differs from volatile, how each should be used, and how they relate to C++'s concurrency API How best practices in \"old\" C++ programming (i.e., C++98) require revision for software development in modern C++ Effective Modern C++ follows the proven guideline-based, example-driven format of Scott Meyers' earlier books, but covers entirely new material. \"After I learned the C++ basics, I then learned how to use C++ in production code from Meyer's series of Effective C++ books.

It allows people to exchange goods and services immediately and with no barriers of time or distance. Any time of the day or night, one may go online and buy almost anything one desires. E-Commerce will engender massive changes in other areas, such as education, health, and government. Initially, E-Commerce was primarily the domain of large firms, due to its initial format of customized, complex, and expensive transactions essential barriers to entry by smaller competitors. Today, for a nominal fee, anyone may become an online merchant, with the potential to reach millions of consumers world-wide. This democratization of the Internet has changed the previous focus of E-Commerce from primarily Business-to-Business transactions between known parties, to a complex web of commercial activities involving huge numbers of consumers who never meet. In essence, the development of the Internet has had the same effect on E-Commerce as Henry Fords assembly line on the automotive industry. It has converted a luxury for the few into a relatively simple and inexpensive device for the masses. In this book, we will explore these impacts and innovations. The purpose of this book is to provide a preliminary analytical foundation (knowledge base), which then may be used for further, more advanced study. It is not intended to be an exhaustive analysis yet at the same time provides as much information as possible to provide an accurate depiction of the current state and likely future direction of E-Commerce.","publisher":"iUniverse","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6VXxz0f6DBcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":121,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6VXxz0f6DBcC&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=377&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"Teach Yourself the UNIX C Shell: In 14 Days","author":"David Ennis, James C.

Headrick","publish_date":"2009-12-08","description":"Although power method polynomials based on the standard normal distributions have been used in many different contexts for the past 30 years, it was not until recently that the probability density function (pdf) and cumulative distribution function (cdf) were derived and made available. Focusing on both univariate and multivariate nonnormal data generation, Statistical Simulation: Power Method Polynomials and Other Transformations presents techniques for conducting a Monte Carlo simulation study. It shows how to use power method polynomials for simulating univariate and multivariate nonnormal distributions with specified cumulants and correlation matrices. The book first explores the methodology underlying the power method, before demonstrating this method through examples of standard normal, logistic, and uniform power method pdfs. It also discusses methods for improving the performance of a simulation based on power method polynomials. The book then develops simulation procedures for systems of linear statistical models, intraclass correlation coefficients, and correlated continuous variates and ranks. Numerical examples and results from Monte Carlo simulations illustrate these procedures. The final chapter describes how the g-and-h and generalized lambda distribution (GLD) transformations are special applications of the more general multivariate nonnormal data generation approach. Throughout the text, the author employs Mathematica® in a range of procedures and offers the source code for download online. Written by a longtime researcher of the power method, this book explains how to simulate nonnormal distributions via easy-to-use power method polynomials. By using the methodology and techniques developed in the text, readers can evaluate different transformations in terms of comparing percentiles, measures of central tendency, goodness-of-fit tests, and more.","publisher":"CRC Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v02dZRSE3TAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":174,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v02dZRSE3TAC&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v02dZRSE3TAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=391&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"Doing business with C","author":"Ray Swartz","publish_date":"1989","description":"A tutorial and reference manual for on-site programmers explains the process of writing C programs to handle commercial applications in both UNIX and DOS environments, illustrating basic C commands and the structure of C programs","publisher":"Prentice Hall Ptr","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uBcpAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":471,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uBcpAQAAMAAJ&q=c,+subject:computers&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=392&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780750687065","title":"Practical UML Statecharts in C/C++: Event-Driven Programming for Embedded Systems","author":"Miro Samek","publish_date":"2009","description":"Explains how to streamline an embedded code project through the use of UML (unified modeling language) statecharts as a framework for creating and maintaining efficient and maintainable systems, describing the new features and functions of the open-source software framework, while discussing statecharts, design applications, and how to code directly into C/C++.

Brewer, Kevin C. Dittman","publish_date":"2013","description":"Designed for graduate, advanced undergraduate, and practitioner project management courses with an information technology focus, Methods of IT Project Management is built around the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK). The text provides students with all of the concepts, techniques, and methods found in the leading project management reference books, while also conveying practical knowledge that can immediately be applied in real-world settings. Unlike other books in this field, the material is organized according to the sequence of the project management life cycle from initial overview, through initiation, execution, and control, to close out. Following this life cycle, as opposed to covering the material by knowledge area, allows students to simultaneously learn project management concepts and methods at the same time as they develop skills they can use immediately during and upon completion of the course. The Project Management Professional (PMP) certification issued by the Project Management Institute (PMI) is the world's leading certification in this field. To help students prepare, the authors have dedicated an appendix to practice study questions and give helpful advice on preparing for and passing the PMP exam. At the end of each chapter, the text provides one or more mini-cases based on the theme of a running case study that extends through the entire book. The mini-cases provide additional opportunities for students to apply project management concepts and techniques, and they are ideal for stimulating class discussions and debates. In addition, these cases also present thought-provoking scenarios to challenge the more advanced student.

Declarations in C, unlike declarations in other languages, also contain arbitrary expressions. Thus, studying the means by which C expressions are constructed and evaluated is especially important-particularly since the number of permissible C operators is so large. Since all of the operands in a C expression (excluding constants) must be properly declared before they are used, and since declarations themselves contain expressions, the teaching of C involves the following chicken-and-egg problem: Should one begin by considering only elementary declarations, in which case the topic of expression construction and evaluation cannot be fully treated in one place, because the operators that pertain to the more complex objects-like pointers and structures (whose declarations have not yet been introduced)--have not yet been covered, or should one postpone entirely the issue of how decla rations are written (merely assuming that all of the objects under discussion have been properly declared) in order to fully treat all types of operands and operators in one comprehensive discussion? If the student is encouraged to begin writing programs immediately, the former choice is mandatory, because even the most elementary programs must vII Preface viii contain proper declarations.

Microsoft’s release of the Kinect in the fall of 2010 startled the technology world by providing a low-cost sensor that can detect and track body movement in three-dimensional space. The Kinect set new records for the fastest-selling gadget of all time. It has been adopted worldwide by hobbyists, robotics enthusiasts, artists, and even some entrepreneurs hoping to build business around the technology. Hacking the Kinect introduces you to programming for the Kinect. You’ll learn to set up a software environment, stream data from the Kinect, and write code to interpret that data. The progression of hands-on projects in the book leads you even deeper into an understanding of how the device functions and how you can apply it to create fun and educational projects. Who knows? You might even come up with a business idea. Provides an excellent source of fun and educational projects for a tech-savvy parent to pursue with a son or daughter Leads you progressively from making your very first connection to the Kinect through mastery of its full feature set Shows how to interpret the Kinect data stream in order to drive your own software and hardware applications, including robotics applications What you’ll learn How to create a software environment and connect to the Kinect from your PC How to create three-dimensional images from the Kinect data stream How to recognize and work around hardware limitations How to build computer interfaces in the style of \"Minority Report\" How to interact directly with objects in the virtual world The ins and outs of point clouds, voxel occupancy maps, depth images, and other fundamentals of volumetric sensor technology Who this book is for Hacking the Kinect is aimed at makers of all types. Tech-savvy artists can use the Kinect to drive three-dimensional, interactive artwork. Robotics hobbyists can create robots capable of “seeing” and responding to human motion and gesture. Programmers can create applications in which users manipulate data through physical motion and gestures. The creative possibilities are limitless, and fun! Hacking the Kinect does require some programming background. Familiarity with programming in C++ or similar languages is assumed. Readers should also be reasonably comfortable working with electronics—for example, with Arduino or similar equipment.

Dragut, Weiyi Meng, Clement T. Yu","publish_date":"2012","description":"There are millions of searchable data sources on the Web and to a large extent their contents can only be reached through their own query interfaces. There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep Web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep Web exploration approaches. This book aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive coverage of the key technologies needed to create high quality integrated query interfaces automatically. The following technical issues are discussed in detail in this book: query interface modeling, query interface extraction, query interface clustering, query interface matching, query interface attribute integration, and query interface integration.

Two contributing factors to this difficulty are the lack of modular design and good program documentation. The lack of modular design in software makes software changes more difficult to implement. The lack of good program documentation makes programs more difficult to understand and to maintain. Formal Specification Techniques for Engineering Modular C Programs describes a novel approach to promote program modularity. This book presents a formal specification language that promotes software modularity through the use of abstract data types even though the underlying programming language does not have such support. This language is structured to allow useful information to be extracted from a specification and used to perform some consistency checks between the specification and its implementation. Formal Specification Techniques for Engineering Modular C Programs also describes a specification-driven software reengineering process model for improving existing programs. The aim of this process is to make existing programs easier to maintain and reuse while keeping their essential functionalities unchanged. Formal Specification Techniques for Engineering Modular C Programs is suitable as a secondary text for graduate level courses in software engineering, and as a reference for researchers and practitioners in industry.","publisher":"Kluwer Academic Pub","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=V6BQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":213,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V6BQAAAAMAAJ&q=c,+subject:computers&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=445&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780198538462","title":"A practical introduction to C","author":"Paul Jarvis","publish_date":"1994","description":"This introduction to the C programming language is geared to students with some programming experience.

In addition to brevity, the structure of the book is meant to minimize page turning by making it unnecessary to flip back to previous pages. For example, to allow the reader to view all the information on a topic at once, the text appears on the left and the corresponding examples on the right of facing pages. The book consists of five chapters as follows: The first two describe the basic techniques of modeling the real world with a database. Chapter Three covers common \"operations\" one can do with a database. Most of these operations pertain to using rather than designing a database; however, a few of them are also crucial for design. \"Dependency and decomposition\" — important in their own right and also required for the final chapter — receive a comprehensive treatment in Chapter Four. The book concludes with Chapter Five's coverage of normalization where the levels of good database design are defined along with procedures for attaining these levels. Also, problems that can occur when a database is not at a given level are described and illustrated by examples.","publisher":"Trafford Publishing","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rZNFwWub_4IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":128,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rZNFwWub_4IC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=452&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"Macintosh C Programming Primer: Inside the toolbox using Think C","author":"Dave Mark, Cartwright Reed","publish_date":"1992","description":"Including valuable new information on THINK C and ResEdit, a primer to mastering the programming functions of Macintosh C shows beginners how to use the Macintosh Toolbox, resources, and Macintosh interface to create stand-alone applications.

We discuss some of the more versatile and popular data structures and explain how to implement and use them to solve a variety of useful problems. The book restricts itself to what can be covered in a one-semester course, without overwhelming the student with complexity and analysis. The approach is practical rather than theoretical. We show how to implement the data structures and operations on them using C. Here's what readers have to say about Data Structures In C: \"It is second to none in terms of clarity, conciseness, choice of topics, coverage, layout, and even price and production value. All the usual linear, tree, and graph data structures and algorithms are covered, all striking the right balance between abstraction and detail.\" \"This book has to be probably the best 'first book' I've ever come across for anyone who wants to learn data structures!\" \"The author makes everything very easy to understand.\" \"It is written very simply yet effectively with great code examples.\" \"The book is well written, and the chapters are very well organized.\" \"The simplicity and the way that this book teach the basics I think makes it the best first book on Data Structures.\" \"All computer science students who wish to grasp a good understanding of these topics in the quickest of time, this it the book for you.\" \"Kalicharan makes everything as simple as possible, but not simpler. Simplicity and crystal clarity are his trademark...It is about helping you to understand Data Structures and, for me, it is simply the best book for doing that.\" \"The author seems to have a knack for boiling the topic down to its barest essentials and explaining those ideas in a way that makes it easy (and actually fun) to understand.\" \"All the major data structure types are so well presented that it is difficult to find any other book(s) or website(s) which explains them better.\" \"It has the best description of pointers (one of the pitfalls for C beginners) I have ever read.\" \"Unlike other C books, Kalicharan gives a brilliant discussion of pointers.\"","publisher":"CreateSpace","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rHVRPgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":330,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":1.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rHVRPgAACAAJ&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=484&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780130307965","title":"Computer Vision","author":"Linda G. Shapiro, George C.

The book provides a basic set of fundamental concepts, (representations of image information, extraction of 3D scene information from 2D images, etc.) algorithms for analyzing images, and discusses some of the exciting evolving application areas of computer vision. The approach is language and software independent, and includes two significant commercial case studies. Imaging and Image Representation. Binary Image Analysis. Pattern Recognition Concepts.

Wake","publish_date":"2002","description":"You know what XP is, how to get it up and running, and how to plan projects using it. Now it's time to expand your use of Extreme Programming and learn the best practices of this popular discipline. In \"Extreme Programming Explored, \" you can read about best practices as learned from the concrete experience of successful XP developers. Author and programmer Bill Wake provides answers to practical questions about XP implementation. Using hands-on examples--including code samples written in the Java programming language--this book demonstrates the day-to-day mechanics of working on an XP team and shows well-defined methods for carrying out a successful XP project. The book is divided into three parts: Part 1, Programming--programming incrementally, test-first, and refactoring. Part 2, Team Practices--code ownership, integration, overtime, and pair programming; how XP approaches system architecture; and how a system metaphor shapes a common vision, a shared vocabulary, and the architecture. Part 3, Processes--how to write stories to plan a release; how to plan iterations; and the activities in a typical day for the customer, the programmer, and the manager of an XP project. To demonstrate how an XP team uses frequent testing, you'll learn how to develop the core of a library search system by unit testing in small increments. To show how to make code ready for major design changes, the author teaches you how to refactor a Java program that generates a Web page. To see how a system metaphor influences the shape of a system, you'll learn about the effects of different metaphors on customer service and word processing applications. To show how customers and programmers participate in release planning, the book demonstrates writing and estimating stories, and shows how the customer plans a release. 0201733978B07052001","publisher":"Addison-Wesley Professional","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L39tQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":159,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L39tQgAACAAJ&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=493&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780782114140","title":"Your first C/C++ program","author":"Alan R.

Taylor maintains, \"is most interesting where it is least obvious.\" From global financial networks to the casinos of Las Vegas, from images flickering on computer terminals to steel sculpture, material culture bears unexpected traces of the divine. In a world where the economies of faith are obscure, yet pervasive, Taylor shows that approaching religion directly is less instructive than thinking about it. Traveling from high culture to pop culture and back again, About Religion approaches cyberspace and Las Vegas through Hegel and Kant and reads Melville's The Confidence-Man through the film Wall Street. As astonishing juxtapositions and associations proliferate, formerly uncharted territories of virtual culture disclose theological vestiges, showing that faith in contemporary culture is as unavoidable as it is elusive. The most accessible presentation of Taylor's revolutionary ideas to date, About Religion gives us a dazzling and disturbing vision of life at the end of the old and beginning of the new millennium.","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hqgnD7DlIkcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":292,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":3.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hqgnD7DlIkcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=521&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780525951346","title":"Total Recall: How the E-memory Revolution Will Change Everything","author":"C.

Dougherty","publish_date":"1994","description":"This book's main goal is to show readers how to use the linguistic theory of Noam Chomsky, called Universal Grammar, to represent English, French, and German on a computer using the Prolog computer language. In so doing, it presents a follow-the-dots approach to natural language processing, linguistic theory, artificial intelligence, and expert systems. The basic idea is to introduce meaningful answers to significant problems involved in representing human language data on a computer. The book offers a hands-on approach to anyone who wishes to gain a perspective on natural language processing -- the computational analysis of human language data. All of the examples are illustrated using computer programs. The optimal way for a person to get started is to run these existing programs to gain an understanding of how they work. After gaining familiarity, readers can begin to modify the programs, and eventually write their own. The first six chapters take a reader who has never heard of non-procedural, backtracking, declarative languages like Prolog and, using 29 full page diagrams and 75 programs, detail how to represent a lexicon of English on a computer. A bibliography is programmed into a Prolog database to show how linguists can manipulate the symbols used in formal representations, including braces and brackets. The next three chapters use 74 full page diagrams and 38 programs to show how data structures (subcategorization, selection, phrase marker) and processes (top-down, bottom-up, parsing, recursion) crucial in Chomsky's theory can be explicitly formulated into a constraint-based grammar and implemented in Prolog. The Prolog interpreters provided with the book are basically identical to the high priced Prologs, but they lack the speed and memory capacities. They are ideal since anything learned about these Prologs carries over unmodified to C-Prolog and Quintas on the mainframes. Anyone who studies the prolog implementations of the lexicons and syntactic principles of combination should be able to use Prolog to represent their own linguistic data on the most complex Prolog computer available, whether their data derive from syntactic theory, semantics, sociolinguistics, bilingualism, language acquisition, language learning, or some related area in which the grammatical patterns of words and phrases are more crucial than concepts of quantity. The printed examples illustrate C-Prolog on an Ultrix Vax, a standard university configuration. The disk included with the book contains shareware version of Prolog-2 (IBM PC) and MacProlog (Macintosh) plus versions of the programs that run on C-Prolog, Quintas, Prolog-2, and MacProlog. Appendix II contains information about how to use the Internet, Gopher, CompuServe, and the free More BBS to download the latest copies of Prolog, programs, lexicons, and parsers. All figures (100+) in the book are available scaled to make full size transparencies for class lectures. Valuable special features of this volume include: * more than 100 full page diagrams illustrating the basic concepts of natural language processing, Prolog, and Chomsky's linguistic theories; * more than 100 programs -- illustrated in at least one script file -- showing how to encode the representations and derivations of generative grammar into Prolog; * more than 100 session files guiding readers through their own hands-on sessions with the programs illustrating Chomsky's theory; * a 3.5\" disk (IBM Format) containing: 1. all programs in versions to run in C-Prolog or Quintas Prolog on an Ultrix Vax, and on an IBM PC and a Macintosh, 2. a shareware version of Prolog-2 for IBM PC clones which runs all programs in the book, 3. a shareware version of MacProlog for Macintosh which runs all programs in the book; * instructions on using Internet, CompuServe, and the free More BBS to download the latest copies of Prolog, programs, lexicons, and parsers; and * numerous references enabling interested students to pursue questions at greater depth by consulting the items in the extensive bibliography.","publisher":"Psychology Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iO8ZNHyJYT8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":349,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iO8ZNHyJYT8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=538&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780393969467","title":"C Programming: A Modern Approach","author":"Kim King, Manuel Bermudez","publish_date":"1998-01-01","description":"With adoptions at over 225 colleges, the first edition of C Programming has been one of the leading C textbooks of the last ten years.

Jepsen","publish_date":"2003","description":"The worldwide market for SAN and NAS storage is anticipated to grow from US $2 billion in 1999 to over $25 billion by 2004. As business-to-business and business-to-consumer e-commerce matures, even greater demands for management of stored data will arise. With the rapid increase in data storage requirements in the last decade, efficient management of stored data becomes a necessity for the enterprise. A recent UC-Berkeley study predicts that 150,000 terabytes of disk storage will be shipped in 2003. Most financial, insurance, healthcare, and telecommunications institutions are in the process of implementing storage networks that are distributed to some degree. For these institutions, data integrity is critical, and they will spend much time and money on planning. One of the primary obstacles to implementing a storage network cited by enterprise IT managers is a lack of knowledge about storage networking technology and the specific issues involved in extending a Storage Area Network (SAN) or Network Attached Storage (NAS) over the Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN) or Wireless Area Networks (WAN). Distributed Storage Networks : Architecture, Protocols and Management addresses the \"terminology gap\" between enterprise network planners and telecommunications engineers, who must understand the transport requirements of storage networks in order to implement distributed storage networks. Jepsen comprehensively provides IT managers, planners, and telecommunications professionals with the information they need in order to choose the technologies best suited for their particular environment. * Addresses a hot topic that will become increasingly important in the coming years * Enables high-level managers and planners to make intelligent decisions about network needs. * Includes example network configurations providing solutions to typical user scenarios * Fills the \"terminology gap\" between enterprise network managers and telecommunications engineers who must understand the transport requirements of storage networks in order to implement distributed storage area networks A fundamental resource for all network managers, planners and network design engineers, as well as telecommunications engineers and engineering, computer science, and information technology students.","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sSzMISQ6fywC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":314,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sSzMISQ6fywC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=544&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781852332846","title":"Architecture-independent Loop Parallelisation","author":"Radu C.

Even though Apple created iPhone as a closed device, tens of thousands of developers bought them with the express purpose of designing and running third-party software. In this clear and concise book, veteran hacker Jonathan Zdziarski -- one of the original hackers of the iPhone -- explains the iPhone's native environment and how you can build software for this device using its Objective-C, C, and C++ development frameworks. iPhone Open Application Development walks you through the iPhone's native development environment, offers an overview of the Objective-C language you'll use with it, and supplies background for the iPhone operating system. You also get detailed recipes and working examples for everyone's favorite iPhone features -- graphics and audio programming, interfaces for adding multitouch functionality to games, the use of hardware sensors, and the device's vast user interface kit. This book explains: How to access the iPhone's underlying operating system The makeup of an iPhone application How to get the open source tool chain running on your desktop The iPhone's core user interface framework, which is heavily tied to major application-level functions Using the many touted iPhone features such as multitouch, hardware sensors, and gestures Intercepting and handling event notifications for many iPhone-related events Raw video surfaces and 3D transformations that take you deeper into advanced graphics on the iPhone How to record and play simple sounds and intercept sound events Advanced digital audio output using Apple's new Audio Toolbox framework Advanced user interface components such as section lists, keyboards, and image manipulation The Appendix includes a compendium of miscellaneous code examples for cool application features, such as using the camera and creating a CoverFlow®-like album browser. This book is a true hacker's book, designed for the millions of users who have run third party applications on their iPhone, but its concepts and code examples have shown to be remarkably similar to Apple's official SDK, making this book a valuable resource for both camps. Any programmer can use this book to write applications with the same spectacular effects that made the device an immediate hit, and impress users just as much as the official iPhone software does. That programmer can easily be you.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Sk5V6jqk8sQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":288,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Sk5V6jqk8sQC&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":4.5,"ratings_count":4,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Sk5V6jqk8sQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=551&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"Learning C by Example: ","author":"Agus Kurniawan","publish_date":null,"description":"This book help you how to get started with C programming.

You can use this book to learn the essentials of the language and to prepare for real-world work. You learn the key concepts as features are added to a short, yet representative C program. The final version of the program reads information from a file describing stock trades and predicts the next-day's price using a straight-line extrapolation, thereby reflecting the popularity of C in applications involving data analysis. As you see the program evolve, you learn how to: define functions; benefit from function abstraction; solve ordering problems with function prototypes; process data from files; create structures and objects; use pointer parameters to avoid argument copying; use pointer parameters to alter values; create new structure objects at run time; define constructors, readers, and writers; benefit from data abstraction; use enumerations and type synonyms to improve readability; use unions to capture class distinctions; use bits to record state information; prevent memory leaks; access command-line arguments; organize and compile multiple-file programs; and much more. Special Features: Illustrates each new idea through an improvement to a short, yet complete program. There are no nonsense programs or rapid shifts among unrelated examples; summarizes key points in the form of easily mastered if-then rules; emphasizes the virtues of function abstraction and data abstraction; and helps you to start a personal library of general-purpose, templatelike patterns.","publisher":"Addison Wesley Longman","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L9GJQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":290,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L9GJQgAACAAJ&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=558&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780201403855","title":"Simple C","author":"James J.

Almost all software companies conduct Technical Aptitude Tests based on C language in their recruitment process. C Language questions are frequently asked in technical Interviews as well. The proficiency in C Language is also important to crack the GATE Computer Science examination. C language is part of the syllabus of various engineering disciplines, BCA, MCA and MSc(Computer Science) curriculums. Due to academic curriculum students become familiar with C, but very few of them have command over C language. The questions asked in the recruitment process are tricky and it tests the in-depth knowledge of C syntax, logical, analytical and debugging abilities of the students. By keeping these things in our mind, we are proposing a book which covers almost all different types of objective questions asked on C Language. We have also given an explanation to each answer; this is useful to students in making them understand the answer and concept completely. All questions discussed in the book are tested in MD-DOS Turbo C environment and utmost care has been taken to give precise answers. The proposed book would be useful for students of different engineering branches who are willing to pursue their career in Software Industries. The book is also useful to MCA, BSc and MSc(Computer Science) and MCS students. Also the book would be quite useful to crack the GATE C Interview Q & A Computer Science examination. The Features of the book are -: 1) The answer of each objective question is explained. 2) The questions focus on making conceptual understanding and not syntax. 3) A sufficient number of examples have been given to cover different aspects. 4) All programs and answers in the book are tested on the standard programming platform. 5) Important theory is given in brief at the beginning of each topic to help in clear understanding of the concepts.

Written from the broad perspective of distributed-memory systems in general it includes topics such as algorithms for maximum flow, program debugging, and simulation that do not appear in more orthodox texts on distributed algorithms. Moving from fundamentals to advances and applications, ten chapters—with exercises and bibliographic notes—cover a variety of topics. These include models of distributed computation, information propagation, leader election, distributed snapshots, network synchronization, self- stability, termination detection, deadlock detection, graph algorithms, mutual exclusion, program debugging, and simulation. All of the algorithms are presented in a clear, template- based format for the description of message-passing computations among the nodes of a connected graph. Such a generic setting allows the treatment of problems originating from many different application areas. The main ideas and algorithms are described in a way that balances intuition and formal rigor—most are preceded by a general intuitive discussion and followed by formal statements as to correctness complexity or other properties.","publisher":"MIT Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fPaGrO8KFqQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":365,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fPaGrO8KFqQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=566&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"The Annotated ANSI C standard: American National Standard for Programming Languages-C : ANSI/ISO 9899-1990","author":"Herbert Schildt","publish_date":"1990","description":"The ANSI C standard sets the specifications all C programmers must follow in creating programs for all types of environments.

Martin Clean Code Collection consists of two bestselling eBooks: Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftmanship The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers In Clean Code, legendary software expert Robert C. Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer--but only if you work at it. You will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code and what’s wrong with it. More important, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft. In The Clean Coder, Martin introduces the disciplines, techniques, tools, and practices of true software craftsmanship. This book is packed with practical advice--about everything from estimating and coding to refactoring and testing. It covers much more than technique: It is about attitude. Martin shows how to approach software development with honor, self-respect, and pride; work well and work clean; communicate and estimate faithfully; face difficult decisions with clarity and honesty; and understand that deep knowledge comes with a responsibility to act. Readers of this collection will come away understanding How to tell the difference between good and bad code How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes How to format code for maximum readability How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic How to unit test and practice test-driven development What it means to behave as a true software craftsman How to deal with conflict, tight schedules, and unreasonable managers How to get into the flow of coding and get past writer’s block How to handle unrelenting pressure and avoid burnout How to combine enduring attitudes with new development paradigms How to manage your time and avoid blind alleys, marshes, bogs, and swamps How to foster environments where programmers and teams can thrive When to say “No”--and how to say it When to say “Yes”--and what yes really means","publisher":"Prentice Hall","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UuBU732z6zgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":701,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UuBU732z6zgC&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":5,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UuBU732z6zgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=576&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"Algorithm Development and Program Design Using C","author":"Gary J.

Learn to Program with C teaches computer programming to the complete beginner using the native C language. As such, it assumes you have no knowledge whatsoever about programming. We discuss only those features and statements in C that are necessary to achieve our goal. Once you learn the principles well, they can be applied to any language. If you are worried that you are not good at high-school mathematics, don’t be. It is a myth that you must be good at mathematics to learn programming. C is considered a 'modern' language even though its roots date back to the 1970s. Originally, C was designed for writing ‘systems’ programs—things like operating systems, editors, compilers, assemblers and input/output utility programs. But, today, C is used for writing all kinds of applications as well—word processing programs, spreadsheet programs, database management programs, accounting programs, games, robots, embedded systems/electronics (i.e., Arduino), educational software—the list is endless.","publisher":"Apress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yKjrsgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":312,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yKjrsgEACAAJ&dq=c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=580&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3}]
