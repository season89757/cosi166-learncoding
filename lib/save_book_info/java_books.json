As multicore processors become the norm, using concurrency effectively becomes essential for building high-performance applications. Java SE 5 and 6 are a huge step forward for the development of concurrent applications, with improvements to the Java Virtual Machine to support high-performance, highly scalable concurrent classes and a rich set of new concurrency building blocks. In Java Concurrency in Practice , the creators of these new facilities explain not only how they work and how to use them, but also the motivation and design patterns behind them. However, developing, testing, and debugging multithreaded programs can still be very difficult; it is all too easy to create concurrent programs that appear to work, but fail when it matters most: in production, under heavy load. Java Concurrency in Practice arms readers with both the theoretical underpinnings and concrete techniques for building reliable, scalable, maintainable concurrent applications. Rather than simply offering an inventory of concurrency APIs and mechanisms, it provides design rules, patterns, and mental models that make it easier to build concurrent programs that are both correct and performant.

With Java 5.0, you'll not only find substantial changes in the platform, but to the language itself-something that developers of Java took five years to complete. The main goal of Java 5.0 is to make it easier for you to develop safe, powerful code, but none of these improvements makes Java any easier to learn, even if you've programmed with Java for years. And that means our bestselling hands-on tutorial takes on even greater significance. Learning Java is the most widely sought introduction to the programming language that's changed the way we think about computing. Our updated third edition takes an objective, no-nonsense approach to the new features in Java 5.0, some of which are drastically different from the way things were done in any previous versions. The most essential change is the addition of \"generics\", a feature that allows developers to write, test, and deploy code once, and then reuse the code again and again for different data types. The beauty of generics is that more problems will be caught during development, and Learning Java will show you exactly how it's done. Java 5.0 also adds more than 1,000 new classes to the Java library. That means 1,000 new things you can do without having to program it in yourself. That's a huge change. With our book's practical examples, you'll come up to speed quickly on this and other new features such as loops and threads. The new edition also includes an introduction to Eclipse, the open source IDE that is growing in popularity. Learning Java, 3rd Edition addresses all of the important uses of Java, such as web applications, servlets, and XML that are increasingly driving enterprise applications.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fu5HtixRje8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":980,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":14,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fu5HtixRje8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780763784331","title":"Programming with Java: A Multimedia Approach","author":"Radhika S Grover","publish_date":"2011-12-28","description":"Every new copy of Programming with Java: A Multimedia Approach is packaged with student access to TuringsCraft CodeLab.

Object-oriented programming is when a programmer defines not only the data type of a data structure, but also the types of operations/functions that can be applied to the data structure. Java is a general purpose programming language with a number of features that make the language well suited for use on the World Wide Web. Fully road tested from the authors own courses, Object-Oriented Design with UML and Java shows how considering the modeling and programming languages together from the start can be beneficial, shifting the emphasis away from detailed programming issues, and instead allowing the focus to fall on the analysis of the meaning and accuracy of the model.

This lively book reveals oddities of the Java programming language through entertaining and thought-provoking programming puzzles.\" --Guy Steele, Sun Fellow and coauthor of The Java™ Language Specification \"I laughed, I cried, I threw up (my hands in admiration).\" --Tim Peierls, president, Prior Artisans LLC, and member of the JSR 166 Expert Group How well do you really know Java? Are you a code sleuth? Have you ever spent days chasing a bug caused by a trap or pitfall in Java or its libraries? Do you like brainteasers? Then this is the book for you! In the tradition of Effective Java™, Bloch and Gafter dive deep into the subtleties of the Java programming language and its core libraries. Illustrated with visually stunning optical illusions, Java™ Puzzlers features 95 diabolical puzzles that educate and entertain. Anyone with a working knowledge of Java will understand the puzzles, but even the most seasoned veteran will find them challenging. Most of the puzzles take the form of a short program whose behavior isn't what it seems. Can you figure out what it does? Puzzles are grouped loosely according to the features they use, and detailed solutions follow each puzzle. The solutions go well beyond a simple explanation of the program's behavior--they show you how to avoid the underlying traps and pitfalls for good. A handy catalog of traps and pitfalls at the back of the book provides a concise taxonomy for future reference. Solve these puzzles and you'll never again fall prey to the counterintuitive or obscure behaviors that can fool even the most experienced programmers.","publisher":"Pearson Education","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RM9sLE0ntQ0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":312,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RM9sLE0ntQ0C&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":3.5,"ratings_count":22,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RM9sLE0ntQ0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=30&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780596001575","title":"Java Security","author":"Scott Oaks","publish_date":"2001","description":"One of Java's most striking claims is that it provides a secure programming environment. Yet despite endless discussion, few people understand precisely what Java's claims mean and how it backs up those claims. If you're a developer, network administrator or anyone else who must understand or work with Java's security mechanisms, Java Security is the in-depth exploration you need. Java Security, 2nd Edition, focuses on the basic platform features of Java that provide security--the class loader, the bytecode verifier, and the security manager--and recent additions to Java that enhance this security model: digital signatures, security providers, and the access controller. The book covers the security model of Java 2, Version 1.3, which is significantly different from that of Java 1.1. It has extensive coverage of the two new important security APIs: JAAS (Java Authentication and Authorization Service) and JSSE (Java Secure Sockets Extension). Java Security, 2nd Edition, will give you a clear understanding of the architecture of Java's security model and how to use that model in both programming and administration. The book is intended primarily for programmers who want to write secure Java applications. However, it is also an excellent resource for system and network administrators who are interested in Java security, particularly those who are interested in assessing the risk of using Java and need to understand how the security model works in order to assess whether or not Java meets their security needs.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EhX9BjHj9M4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":599,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EhX9BjHj9M4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=31&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781449390877","title":"Java Enterprise Best Practices","author":"O'Reilly Java Authors","publish_date":"2002-12-18","description":"Java developers typically go through four \"stages\" in mastering Java. In the first stage, they learn the language itself. In the second stage, they study the APIs. In the third stage, they become proficient in the environment. It is in the fourth stage --\"the expert stage\"-- where things really get interesting, and Java Enterprise Best Practices is the tangible compendium of experience that developers need to breeze through this fourth and final stage of Enterprise Java mastery.Crammed with tips and tricks, Java Enterprise Best Practices distills years of solid experience from eleven experts in the J2EE environment into a practical, to-the-point guide to J2EE.Java Enterprise Best Practices gives developers the unvarnished, expert-tested advice that the man pages don't provide--what areas of the APIs should be used frequently (and which are better avoided); elegant solutions to problems you face that other developers have already discovered; what things you should always do, what things you should consider doing, and what things you should never do--even if the documentation says it's ok.Until Java Enterprise Best Practices, Java developers in the fourth stage of mastery relied on the advice of a loose-knit community of fellow developers, time-consuming online searches for examples or suggestions for the immediate problem they faced, and tedious trial-and-error. But Java has grown to include a huge number of APIs, classes, and methods. Now it is simply too large for even the most intrepid developer to know it all. The need for a written compendium of J2EE Best Practices has never been greater.Java Enterprise Best Practices focuses on the Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) APIs. The J2EE APIs include such alphabet soup acronyms as EJB, JDBC, RMI, XML, and JMX.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YFB8vndosmUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":292,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YFB8vndosmUC&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YFB8vndosmUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=32&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9788120316201","title":"OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING WITH C++ AND JAVA","author":"DEBASIS SAMANTA","publish_date":"2006-01-01","description":"This book is designed to introduce object-oriented programming (OOP) in C++ and Java, and is divided into four areas of coverage: Preliminaries: Explains the basic features of C, C++, and Java such as data types, operators, control structures, storage classes, and array structures.

Calvert, Michael J. Donahoo","publish_date":"2011-08-29","description":"The networking capabilities of the Java platform have been extended considerably since the first edition of the book. This new edition covers version 1.5-1.7, the most current iterations, as well as making the following improvements: The API (application programming interface) reference sections in each chapter, which describe the relevant parts of each class, have been replaced with (i) a summary section that lists the classes and methods used in the code, and (ii) a ?gotchas? section that mentions nonobvious or poorly-documented aspects of the objects. In addition, the book covers several new classes and capabilities introduced in the last few revisions of the Java platform. New abstractions to be covered include NetworkInterface, InterfaceAddress, Inet4/6Address, SocketAddress/InetSocketAddress, Executor, and others; extended access to low-level network information; support for IPv6; more complete access to socket options; and scalable I/O. The example code is also modified to take advantage of new language features such as annotations, enumerations, as well as generics and implicit iterators where appropriate. Most Internet applications use sockets to implement network communication protocols. This book's focused, tutorial-based approach helps the reader master the tasks and techniques essential to virtually all client-server projects using sockets in Java. Chapter 1 provides a genral overview of networking concepts to allow readers to synchronize the concepts with terminology. Chapter 2 introduces the mechanics of simple clients and servers. Chapter 3 covers basic message construction and parsing. Chapter 4 then deals with techniques used to build more robust clients and servers. Chapter 5 (NEW) introduces the scalable interface facilities which were introduced in Java 1.5, including the buffer and channel abstractions. Chapter 6 discusses the relationship between the programming constructs and the underlying protocol implementations in more detail. Programming concepts are introduced through simple program examples accompanied by line-by-line code commentary that describes the purpose of every part of the program. The book's Web site contains many examples of command-based sockets-related code discussed throughout the book. No other resource presents so concisely or so effectively the material necessary to get up and running with Java sockets programming. KEY FEATURES * Focused, tutorial-based instruction in key sockets programming techniques allows reader to quickly come up to speed on Java applications. * Concise and up-to-date coverage of the most recent platform (1.7) for Java applications in networking technology * Provides code for all example programs via a companion Web site to let the reader see the important objects and methods in context and to understand the purpose of each line of code.","publisher":"Morgan Kaufmann","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lfHo7uMk7r4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":192,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lfHo7uMk7r4C&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":2,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lfHo7uMk7r4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=47&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780130170071","title":"Multithreaded Programming with Java Technology","author":"Bil Lewis, Daniel J.

Cryptography provides three services that are crucial in secure programming. These include a cryptographic cipher that protects the secrecy of your data; cryptographic certificates, which prove identity (authentication); and digital signatures, which ensure your data has not been damaged or tampered with.This book covers cryptographic programming in Java. Java 1.1 and Java 1.2 provide extensive support for cryptography with an elegant architecture, the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA). Another set of classes, the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE), provides additional cryptographic functionality. This book covers the JCA and the JCE from top to bottom, describing the use of the cryptographic classes as well as their innards.The book is designed for moderately experienced Java programmers who want to learn how to build cryptography into their applications. No prior knowledge of cryptography is assumed.

Java provides many different kinds of streams, each with its own application. The universe of streams is divided into four large categories: input streams and output streams, for reading and writing binary data; and readers and writers, for reading and writing textual (character) data. You're almost certainly familiar with the basic kinds of streams--but did you know that there's a CipherInputStream for reading encrypted data? And a ZipOutputStream for automatically compressing data? Do you know how to use buffered streams effectively to make your I/O operations more efficient?Java I/Otells you all you ever need to know about streams--and probably more. A discussion of I/O wouldn't be complete without treatment of character sets and formatting. Java supports the UNICODE standard, which provides definitions for the character sets of most written languages. Consequently, Java is the first programming language that lets you do I/O in virtually any language. Java also provides a sophisticated model for formatting textual and numeric data.Java I/Oshows you how to control number formatting, use characters aside from the standard (but outdated) ASCII character set, and get a head start on writing truly multilingual software.

These include APIs for high-performance I/O operations, regular expression processing, and character set coding. These new libraries are a treasure trove for java developers. The NIO APIs are especially valuable where high-performance I/O is a requirement, but they can also be useful in a wide range of scenarios. The new APIs let you work directly with I/O buffers, multiplex nonblocking streams, do scattering reads and gathering writes, do channel-to-channel transfers, work with memory-mapped files, manage file locks, and much more. The new high-performance Regular Expression Library provides sophisticated, Perl-like regex-processing features such as pattern matching, search and replace, capture groups, look ahead assertions, and many others. The Charset API gives you complete control over character set encoding and decoding, which are vital for properly managing the exchange of documents on the Web, for localization, or for other purposes. You can also create and install your own custom character sets. Staying current with the latent java technology is never easy. NIO, new in Java 1.4, is quite possibly the most important new java feature since Swing. Understanding it thoroughly is essential for any serious Java developer. NIO closes the gap between java and natively compiled languages and enables java applications to achieve maximum I/O performance by effectively leveraging operating-system services in a portable way.

The three key technologies covered in this book, the Spring Framework, Hibernate and Eclipse, help reduce the complexity of enterprise Java development significantly. Furthermore, these technologies enable plain old Java objects (POJOs) to be deployed in light-weight containers versus heavy-handed remote objects that require heavy EJB containers. This book also extensively covers technologies such as Ant, JUnit, JSP tag libraries and touches upon other areas such as such logging, GUI based debugging, monitoring using JMX, job scheduling, emailing, and more. Also, Extreme Programming (XP), Agile Model Driven Development (AMDD) and refactoring are methods that can expedite the software development projects by reducing the amount of up front requirements and design; hence these methods are embedded throughout the book but with just enough details and examples to not sidetrack the focus of this book. In addition, this book contains well separated, subjective material (opinion sidebars), comic illustrations, tips and tricks, all of which provide real-world and practical perspectives on relevant topics. Last but not least, this book demonstrates the complete lifecycle by building and following a sample application, chapter-by-chapter, starting from conceptualization to production using the technology and processes covered in this book.

If you are interested in the nature of computation and curious about the very idea behind object orientation, this book is for you. This book will engage your brain (if not your tummy). Through its sparkling interactive style, you will learn about three essential OO concepts: interfaces, visitors, and factories. A refreshing change from the 'yet another Java book' phenomenon. Every serious Java programmer should own a copy.' -- Gary McGraw, Ph.D., Research Scientist at Reliable Software Technologies and coauthor of Java Security Java is a new object-oriented programming language that was developed by Sun Microsystems for programming the Internet and intelligent appliances. In a very short time it has become one of the most widely used programming languages for education as well as commercial applications. Design patterns, which have moved object-oriented programming to a new level, provide programmers with a language to communicate with others about their designs. As a result, programs become more readable, more reusable, and more easily extensible. In this book, Matthias Felleisen and Daniel Friedman use a small subset of Java to introduce pattern-directed program design. With their usual clarity and flair, they gently guide readers through the fundamentals of object-oriented programming and pattern-based design. Readers new to programming, as well as those with some background, will enjoy their learning experience as they work their way through Felleisen and Friedman's dialogue. src='/graphics/yellowball.gif' href='/books/FELTP/Java-fm.html'Foreword and Preface","publisher":"MIT Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7BWvrY1zPtoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":179,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":3.5,"ratings_count":3,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7BWvrY1zPtoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=109&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781449361457","title":"RESTful Java with JAX-RS 2.0","author":"Bill Burke","publish_date":"2013-11-12","description":"Learn how to design and develop distributed web services in Java, using RESTful architectural principles and the JAX-RS 2.0 specification in Java EE 7.

Cook","publish_date":"2005","description":"\"Blue Pelican Java\" is a somewhat unusual high school computer science textbook. Most computer science texts will begin with a section on the history of computers followed with a flurry of definitions that are just \"so many words\" to the average student. The approach here is to first give the student some experience upon which to hang the definitions that come later. The usual practice of introducing classes and objects is deferred until the student has a firm grasp of the fundamentals (loops, decision structures, etc). Thus, the beginning student is not overwhelmed by the simultaneous introduction of OOPs and the fundamentals. The book includes plenty of exercises (many in \"contest\" form), programming projects, and a huge appendix.","publisher":"Virtualbookworm Publishing","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PBPgvutXQOgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":544,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PBPgvutXQOgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=116&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781430225546","title":"Beginning Java Google App Engine","author":"Kyle Roche, Jeff Douglas","publish_date":"2011-01-30","description":"Google App Engine is one of the key technologies to emerge in recent years to help you build scalable web applications even if you have limited previous experience. If you are a Java programmer, this book offers you a Java approach to beginning Google App Engine. You will explore the runtime environment, front-end technologies like Google Web Toolkit, Adobe Flex, and the datastore behind App Engine. You'll also explore Java support on App Engine from end to end. The journey begins with a look at the Google Plugin for Eclipse and finishes with a working web application that uses Google Web Toolkit, Google Accounts, and Bigtable. Along the way, you'll dig deeply into the services that are available to access the datastore with a focus on Java Data Objects (JDO), JDOQL, and other aspects of Bigtable. With this solid foundation in place, you'll then be ready to tackle some of the more advanced topics like integration with other cloud platforms such as Salesforce.com and Google Wave.

Practical Java Game Programming identifies the technological path developers need to take to make this happen. It explores and illustrates cutting-edge Java game programming concepts and techniques through specific explanations from existing Java game projects, with fully executable example code. Intended for both Java programmers new to game development, and for game programmers interested in Java, the book offers usage patterns that leverage Java's strengths and points out weaknesses to avoid. It teaches Java programmers how to deliver outstanding games and details the specific issues in Java to make game development straightforward and efficient. Java has always provided a powerful platform on which to develop interactive content, and with the addition of the Java Technology GroupÃƒÂ­s gaming APIs, Java becomes a third-party platform choice and delivery model for game developers. Each chapter includes working code examples that can stand alone for easy implementation into one's own projects, or be used toward the creation of a fully functional demo game. This allows beginning programmers to follow the topics step-by-step, and more experienced programmers to use specific areas of interest. Although this book is centered on Java and the platform technologies, its message is for developers to maintain a wide view regarding new technologies, as well as to keep creative ingenuity intact while implementing games on the Java platform.","publisher":"Charles River Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JOlZEWJmQdgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":508,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":3,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JOlZEWJmQdgC&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=120&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780764579431","title":"Ivor Horton's Beginning Java 2","author":"Ivor Horton","publish_date":"2005-01-03","description":"What is this book about?

Programming problems are used as exercises to enforce a programming paradigm. A high percent of learning to program is highly correlated with the practice of designing and implementing programs for specific requirements. The translator or compiler will enhance the student knowledge through the trail and error process of removing errors from their programs. Emphasis is on defining Java constructs and their use in programming. Students are encouraged to program all the exercises at the end of each Chapter. Also students are encouraged to program their own applications to enhance their knowledge base. The idea is to program as many applications as possible using various Java constructs to improve programming skills in the Java programming language. Emphasis is placed on programming applications requirements. To enforce this paradigm Chapters are organized to maximize the learning process. Chapters on Exceptions and File Input and Output are introduced early in the text. After the file input and output are introduced all programs should read and write files to devices to maximize the learning experience.","publisher":"iUniverse","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=24mo2yjQ6L0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":248,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":3.5,"ratings_count":2,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=24mo2yjQ6L0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=148&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780132713009","title":"SOA Using Java Web Services","author":"Mark D.

Author Mark Hansen presents in explicit detail the information that enterprise developers and architects need to succeed, from best-practice design techniques to state-of-the-art code samples. Hansen covers creating, deploying, and invoking Web services that can be composed into loosely coupled SOA applications. He begins by reviewing the “big picture,” including the challenges of Java-based SOA development and the limitations of traditional approaches. Next, he systematically introduces the latest Java Web Services (JWS) APIs and walks through creating Web services that integrate into a comprehensive SOA solution. Finally, he shows how application frameworks based on JWS can streamline the entire SOA development process and introduces one such framework: SOA-J. The book Introduces practical techniques for managing the complexity of Web services and SOA, including best-practice design examples Offers hard-won insights into building effective SOA applications with Java Web Services Illuminates recent major JWS improvements–including two full chapters on JAX-WS 2.0 Thoroughly explains SOA integration using WSDL, SOAP, Java/XML mapping, and JAXB 2.0 data binding Walks step by step through packaging and deploying Web services components on Java EE 5 with JSR-181 (WS-Metadata 2.0) and JSR-109 Includes specific code solutions for many development issues, from publishing REST endpoints to consuming SOAP services with WSDL Presents a complete case study using the JWS APIs, together with an Ajax front end, to build a SOA application integrating Amazon, Yahoo Shopping, and eBay Contains hundreds of code samples–all tested with the GlassFish Java EE 5 reference implementation–that are downloadable from the companion Web site, http://soabook.com.

JPA provides Java developers with both the knowledge and insight needed to write Java applications that access relational databases through JPA. Authors Mike Keith and Merrick Schincariol take a hands–on approach to teaching by giving examples to illustrate each concept of the API and showing how it is used in practice. All of the examples use a common model from an overriding sample application, giving readers a context from which to start and helping them to understand the examples within an already familiar domain. After completing the book, you will have a full understanding and be able to successfully code applications using JPA. The book also serves as a reference guide during initial and later JPA application experiences. Hands-on examples for all the aspects of the JPA specification, based on the reference implementation of this specification A special section on migration to JPA Expert insight about various aspects of the API and when they are useful Portability hints to provide increased awareness of the potential for non–portable JPA code What you’ll learn Get started with enterprise applications using JPA 2 Get up to speed with object–relational mapping and Entity Manager Learn and use queries and the query language (JP QL) Employ advanced object–relational mapping techniques Use XML mapping files and learn other advanced techniques Package and deploy your Java persistence applications Test your Java persistence applications Migrate your Java persistence applications Who this book is for The book generally targets enterprise and persistence developers who fall in one of three categories: Those who are new to persistence; we will present some background information and introduce these readers to the basic persistence concepts to bring them up to speed. Those who know and/or use existing ORM persistence products such as Hibernate or TopLink. Those who have already used JPA and want to learn about newer features introduced by JPA 2, or have a good reference book to consult when they develop JPA applications.

Regardless of major, students will be able to grasp concepts of problem-solving and programming — thanks to Liang's fundamentals-first approach, students learn critical problem solving skills and core constructs before object-oriented programming. Liang's approach has been extended to application-rich programming examples, which go beyond the traditional math-based problems found in most texts. Students are introduced to topics like control statements, methods, and arrays before learning to create classes. Later chapters introduce advanced topics including graphical user interface, exception handling, I/O, and data structures. Small, simple examples demonstrate concepts and techniques while longer examples are presented in case studies with overall discussions and thorough line-by-line explanations.

Groovy has much in common with popular scripting languages such as Perl, Python, and Ruby, but is written in a Java-like syntax. And, unlike these other languages, Groovy is sanctioned by the Java community for use on the Java platform. Since it is based on Java, applications written in Groovy can make full use of the Java Application Programmer Interfaces (APIs). This means Groovy can integrate seamlessly with applications written in Java, while avoiding the complexities of the full Java language. This bare-bones structure also means Groovy can be used as an introduction to Java and to programming in general. Its simpler constructions and modern origins make it ideal as a first language and for introducing principles such as object-oriented programming. This book introduces all the major aspects of Groovy development and emphasizes Groovy's potential as a learning tool. Case studies and exercises are included, along with numerous programming examples. The book begins assuming only a general familiarity with Java programming, and progresses to discuss advanced topics such as GUI builders, Groovlets, Unit Testing, and Groovy SQL. * The first comprehensive book on Groovy programming that shows how writing applications and scripts for the Java platform is fast and easy * Written by leading software engineers and acclaimed computing instructors * Offers numerous programming examples, code samples, detailed case studies, exercises for self-study, and a companion website with a Windows-based Groovy editor","publisher":"Morgan Kaufmann","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kV8GYTCDf9AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":496,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kV8GYTCDf9AC&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":5,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kV8GYTCDf9AC&printsec=frontcover&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=188&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780201750447","title":"Java Design: Objects, UML, and Process","author":"Kirk Knoernschild","publish_date":"2002","description":"A systematic approach to striving for perfection in Java \"TM\" enterprise software! -- Principles and best-practice patterns for the key design and implementation problems facing enterprise developers. -- Effective integration of UML, object-oriented development, Java \"TM,\" and your software development processes. -- Identifies behavioral and structural modeling techniques that deliver exceptional value. Drawing upon the experiences of hundreds of developers he has trained or worked with, Kirk Knoernschild offers a systematic guide to solving today's complex problems of Java-based enterprise application design and implementation. Knoernschild focuses on both technology and process, offering a phased approach to integrating UML, object-oriented development, and Java \"TM\" throughout the entire development lifecycle. Knoernschild begins by reintroducing objects and object-oriented design, presenting key concepts such as polymorphism and inheritance in terms of several powerful principles and patterns that inform the entire book. Next, he introduces the UML: how it evolved, the problems it helps to solve, and how various UML constructs can be mapped to Java. Knoernschild shows how to structure UML diagrams to more easily identify the problem being solved, introduces best practices that any software development process should promote, and shows how the UML fits with these best practices. He reviews the external considerations that impact how companies really use the UML, Java \"TM,\" and object-based techniques, presenting a pragmatic, phased approach to integrating them with the least pain and the greatest effectiveness.

Drawing upon the experiences of hundreds of developers he has trained or worked with, Kirk Knoernschild offers a systematic guide to solving today's complex problems of Java-based enterprise application design and implementation. Knoernschild focuses on both technology and process, offering a phased approach to integrating UML, object-oriented development, and Java \"TM\" throughout the entire development lifecycle. Knoernschild begins by reintroducing objects and object-oriented design, presenting key concepts such as polymorphism and inheritance in terms of several powerful principles and patterns that inform the entire book. Next, he introduces the UML: how it evolved, the problems it helps to solve, and how various UML constructs can be mapped to Java. Knoernschild shows how to structure UML diagrams to more easily identify the problem being solved, introduces best practices that any software development process should promote, and shows how the UML fits with these best practices. He reviews the external considerations that impact how companies really use the UML, Java \"TM,\" and object-based techniques, presenting a pragmatic, phased approach to integrating them with the least pain and the greatest effectiveness.

Many companies address this issue by assigning a dedicated software testing phase towards the end of their development cycle. However, quality cannot be tested into a buggy application. Early and continuous unit testing has been shown to be crucial for high quality software and low defect rates. Yet current books on testing ignore the developer's point of view and give little guidance on how to bring the overwhelming amount of testing theory into practice. Unit Testing in Java represents a practical introduction to unit testing for software developers. It introduces the basic test-first approach and then discusses a large number of special issues and problem cases. The book instructs developers through each step and motivates them to explore further. *Shows how the discovery and avoidance of software errors is a demanding and creative activity in its own right and can build confidence early in a project. *Demonstrates how automated tests can detect the unwanted effects of small changes in code within the entire system. *Discusses how testing works with persistency, concurrency, distribution, and web applications. *Includes a discussion of testing with C++ and Smalltalk.","publisher":"Morgan Kaufmann","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I0NWg5is6O0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":376,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I0NWg5is6O0C&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I0NWg5is6O0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=211&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780789725936","title":"Java 2 by Example","author":"Geoff Friesen, Jeff Friesen","publish_date":"2002","description":"Java 2 by Example, Second Edition gives novice programmers in-depth coverage of both object-oriented programming and Java fundamentals.

The author includes a chapter applying the concepts of OOP to object-oriented analysis and design methods. Later chapters demonstrate organizing data in collections and utilizing Java's built-in mathematical functions. Along the way, readers learn from hundreds of examples explaining every concept. Plus, each chapter ends with a series of review questions to ensure that readers are caught up - with answers provided in an appendix.","publisher":"Que Publishing","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bSv3yiJ7cn0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":829,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bSv3yiJ7cn0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=212&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"Java Security Handbook","author":"Jamie Jaworski, Paul J.

In fact, EJB 3.0 is being hailed as the new standard of server-side business logic programming. And O'Reilly's award-winning book on EJB has been refreshed just in time to capitalize on the technology's latest rise in popularity. This fifth edition, written by Bill Burke and Richard Monson-Haefel, has been updated to capture the very latest need-to-know Java technologies in the same award-winning fashion that drove the success of the previous four strong-selling editions. Bill Burke, Chief Architect at JBoss, Inc., represents the company on the EJB 3.0 and Java EE 5 specification committees. Richard Monson-Haefel is one of the world's leading experts on Enterprise Java. Enterprise JavaBeans 3.0, 5th Edition is organized into two parts: the technical manuscript followed by the JBoss workbook. The technical manuscript explains what EJB is, how it works, and when to use it. The JBoss workbook provides step-by-step instructions for installing, configuring, and running the examples from the manuscript on the JBoss 4.0 Application Server. Although EJB makes application development much simpler, it's still a complex and ambitious technology that requires a great deal of time to study and master. But now, thanks to Enterprise JavaBeans 3.0, 5th Edition, you can overcome the complexities of EJBs and learn from hundreds of practical examples that are largeenough to test key concepts but small enough to be taken apart and explained in the detail that you need. Now you can harness the complexity of EJB with just a single resource by your side.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T5okbaR3X2kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":768,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T5okbaR3X2kC&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":3.5,"ratings_count":11,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T5okbaR3X2kC&printsec=frontcover&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=224&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780131428485","title":"UML for Java Programmers","author":"Robert C.

Many companies address this issue by assigning a dedicated software testing phase towards the end of their development cycle. However, quality cannot be tested into a buggy application. Early and continuous unit testing has been shown to be crucial for high quality software and low defect rates. Yet current books on testing ignore the developer's point of view and give little guidance on how to bring the overwhelming amount of testing theory into practice. Unit Testing in Java represents a practical introduction to unit testing for software developers. It introduces the basic test-first approach and then discusses a large number of special issues and problem cases. The book instructs developers through each step and motivates them to explore further. *Shows how the discovery and avoidance of software errors is a demanding and creative activity in its own right and can build confidence early in a project. *Demonstrates how automated tests can detect the unwanted effects of small changes in code within the entire system. *Discusses how testing works with persistency, concurrency, distribution, and web applications. *Includes a discussion of testing with C++ and Smalltalk.","publisher":"Morgan Kaufmann","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I0NWg5is6O0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":376,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I0NWg5is6O0C&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I0NWg5is6O0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=238&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781844804184","title":"Java Actually: A First Course in Programming","author":"Khalid Azim Mughal, Torill Hamre, Rolf W.

Oracle is arguably the most widely used relational database platform in the world. In this book, Donald Bales brings these two technologies together, and shows you how to leverage the full power of Oracle's implementation of JDBC. You begin by learning the all-important mysteries of establishing database connections. This can be one of the most frustrating areas for programmers new to JDBC, and Donald covers it well with detailed information and examples showing how to make database connections from applications, applets, Servlets, and even from Java programs running within the database itself. Next comes thorough coverage of JDBC's relational SQL features. You'll learn how to issue SQL statements and get results back from the database, how to read and write data from large, streaming data types such as BLOBs, CLOBs, and BFILEs, and you'll learn how to interface with Oracle's other built-in programming language, PL/SQL. If you're taking advantage of the Oracle's relatively new ability to create object tables and column objects based on user-defined datatypes, you'll be pleased with Don's thorough treatment of this subject. Don shows you how to use JPublisher and JDBC to work seamlessly with Oracle database objects from within Java programs. You'll also learn how to access nested tables and arrays using JDBC. Donald concludes the book with a discussion of transaction management, locking, concurrency, and performance--topics that every professional JDBC programmer must be familiar with. If you write Java programs to run against an Oracle database, this book is a must-have.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r13SMVABpx4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":477,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r13SMVABpx4C&pg=PA113&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=258&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781783283989","title":"OpenCV 3.0 Computer Vision with Java","author":"Daniel Lélis Baggio","publish_date":"2015-07-30","description":"OpenCV 3.0 Computer Vision with Java is a practical tutorial guide that explains fundamental tasks from computer vision while focusing on Java development.

C# for Java Programmers will prepare readers for the .NET framework by building on what they already know about object-oriented languages and give them the means to maintain their flexibility and effectiveness in an un-certain marketplace. This book will compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of both Java and C# to allow programmers to make their own decisions regarding what each language is best used for. Whatever your feelings are about Microsoft and its .NET initiative, there can be no denying that C# is here to stay. The C# language, a close cousin to Java, is a new object-oriented programming language (OOPL) designed to work within the .NET framework. It improves upon many of the vague or ill-defined areas of C++ that frequently lead programmers into trouble. C# is a strongly-typed, object-oriented language designed to give the optimum blend of simplicity, expressiveness, and performance. Written specifically for Java programmers. C# for Java Programmers is not an introductory guide to C#, but builds on what Java programmers already know about object-oriented languages to give them an efficient means for making in-roads to the .NET framework. Compare and Contrast. This book will compare and contrast many of the advantages and drawbacks of Java and C# to allow programmers to make informed, intelligent decisions based on the unique uses of each language. Make your own in-depth analysis of C# and Java with the Syngress Wallet CD.

Oracle is arguably the most widely used relational database platform in the world. In this book, Donald Bales brings these two technologies together, and shows you how to leverage the full power of Oracle's implementation of JDBC. You begin by learning the all-important mysteries of establishing database connections. This can be one of the most frustrating areas for programmers new to JDBC, and Donald covers it well with detailed information and examples showing how to make database connections from applications, applets, Servlets, and even from Java programs running within the database itself. Next comes thorough coverage of JDBC's relational SQL features. You'll learn how to issue SQL statements and get results back from the database, how to read and write data from large, streaming data types such as BLOBs, CLOBs, and BFILEs, and you'll learn how to interface with Oracle's other built-in programming language, PL/SQL. If you're taking advantage of the Oracle's relatively new ability to create object tables and column objects based on user-defined datatypes, you'll be pleased with Don's thorough treatment of this subject. Don shows you how to use JPublisher and JDBC to work seamlessly with Oracle database objects from within Java programs. You'll also learn how to access nested tables and arrays using JDBC. Donald concludes the book with a discussion of transaction management, locking, concurrency, and performance--topics that every professional JDBC programmer must be familiar with. If you write Java programs to run against an Oracle database, this book is a must-have.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r13SMVABpx4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":477,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r13SMVABpx4C&pg=PA362&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=292&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781930110588","title":"Java Development with Ant","author":"Erik Hatcher, Steve Loughran","publish_date":"2003","description":"Introduces the build tool for Java application development, covering both user defined and built-in tasks.","publisher":"Manning Publications","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gPPsmUoIS-UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":634,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gPPsmUoIS-UC&q=java,+subject:computers&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=293&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"QuickTime for Java: A Developer Reference","author":"Tom Maremaa, William Stewart","publish_date":"1999-01-01","description":"This guide provides the reader with a wealth of programming examples as well as a reference that provides an in-depth, class by class description of the API.

Advanced System Design with Java, UML and MDA describes the factors involved in designing and constructing large systems, illustrating the design process through a series of examples, including a Scrabble player, a jukebox using web streaming, a security system, and others. The book first considers the challenges of software design, before introducing the Unified Modelling Language and Object Constraint Language. The book then moves on to discuss systems design as a whole, covering internet systems design, web services, Flash, XML, XSLT, SOAP, Servlets, Javascript and JSP.

As is done in industry, these steps are sometimes performed in an iterative fashion rather than in strict sequence. The Java Application Programming Interface (API) is used throughout the text.

Coad and his co-authors use four colors to represent four archetypes-little forms that appear again and again in effective component and object models. Given a color, you'll know the kind of attributes, links, methods, and interactions that particular class is likely to have. You develop little color building blocks that will help you build better models and get the recognition you deserve. Color and archetypes are only the beginning. Coad and his co-authors go further, plugging those archetypes into a 12-class, domain-neutral component. Every model Coad has built over the past decade follows the basic shape and responsibilities expressed in this one component. Coad and his co-authors go even further, taking the domain-neutral component and applying it in a wide variety of business areas. So you end up with specific examples for your business, examples you can relate to, readily understand, and benefit from. \"Java Modeling in Color with UML: Enterprise Components and Process\" delivers 61 components, 283 classes, 46 interfaces, 671 attributes, 1139 methods, and 65 interaction sequences. On top of all of this, Coad, Lefebvre, and De Luca present \"Feature-Driven Development (FDD),\" the process for getting the most out of your Java modeling and development, delivering frequent, tangible, working results on time and within budget. \"This book brings a new dimension to the effective use of the UML, by showing you how to apply archetypes in color to enrich the content of your models.--Grady Booch, \"Chief Scientist, Rational Software Corporation\" \"Iwent for a job interview. The interviewer asked me to model a payroll system and gave me an hour to work it out while he observed. So I built a model using pink moment-intervals, yellow roles, green things, and blue descriptions-classes, attributes, links, methods, interactions. After 25 minutes the interviewer stopped me, saying I had already gone well beyond what others struggle to do in a full hour! So my recommendation is: read this book!

Author Bruno Preiss presents the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms from a modern, object-oriented perspective. The text promotes object-oriented design using Java and illustrates the use of the latest object-oriented design patterns. Virtually all the data structures are discussed in the context of a single class hierarchy. This framework clearly shows the relationships between data structures and illustrates how polymorphism and inheritance can be used effectively. Key Features of the Text * All data structures are presented using a common framework. This shows the relationship between the data structures and how they are implemented. * Object-oriented design patterns are used to demonstrate how a good design fits together and transcends the problem at hand. * A single Java software design is used throughout the text to provide a better understanding of the operation of complicated data structures. * Just-in-time presentation of mathematical analysis techniques introduces students to mathematical concepts as needed.

Cucumber - the popular, open-source tool that helps teams communicate more effectively with their customers - now has a Java version, and our bestselling Cucumber Book has been updated to match. The Cucumber for Java Book has the same great advice about how to deliver rock-solid applications collaboratively, but with all code completely rewritten in Java. New chapters cover features unique to the Java version of Cucumber, and reflect insights from the Cucumber team since the original book was published. Until now it's been difficult for teams developing Java applications to learn how to benefit from Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD). This book changes all that by describing in detail how to use Cucumber to harness the power of plain language specifications in your development process. In part 1, you'll discover how to use Cucumber's Gherkin DSL to describe the behavior your customers want from the system. You'll also learn how to write Java code that interprets those plain language specifications and checks them against your application. Part 2 guides you through a worked example, using Spring, MySQL, and Jetty. Enhanced chapters teach you how to use Selenium to drive your application and handle asynchronous Ajax calls, and new chapters cover Dependency Injection (DI) and advanced techniques to help keep your test suites fast. Part 3 shows you how to integrate Cucumber with your Continuous Integration (CI) system, work with a REST web service, and even use BDD with legacy applications. Written by the creator of Cucumber and two of its most experienced users and contributors, The Cucumber for Java Book is an authoritative guide that will give you and your team all the knowledge you need to start using Cucumber with confidence.","publisher":null,"image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zQ2voQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":338,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zQ2voQEACAAJ&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=373&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"Core Java 2: Fundamentals","author":"Cay S.

As the first language designed from the bottom up with networking in mind, Java makes it very easy for computers to cooperate. Even the simplest applet running in a browser is a distributed application, if you think about it. The client running the browser downloads and executes code that is delivered by some other system. But even this simple applet wouldn't be possible without Java's guarantees of portability and security: the applet can run on any platform, and can't sabotage its host.Of course, when we think of distributed computing, we usually think of applications more complex than a client and server communicating with the same protocol. We usually think in terms of programs that make remote procedure calls, access remote databases, and collaborate with others to produce a single result. Java Distributed Computing discusses how to design and write such applications. It covers Java's RMI (Remote Method Invocation) facility and CORBA, but it doesn't stop there; it tells you how to design your own protocols to build message passing systems and discusses how to use Java's security facilities, how to write multithreaded servers, and more. It pays special attention to distributed data systems, collaboration, and applications that have high bandwidth requirements.In the future, distributed computing can only become more important.Java Distributed Computing provides a broad introduction to the problems you'll face and the solutions you'll find as you write distributed computing applications.Topics covered in Java Distributed Computing: Introduction to Distributed Computing Networking Basics Distributed Objects (Overview of CORBA and RMI) Threads Security Message Passing Systems Distributed Data Systems (Databases) Bandwidth Limited Applications Collaborative Systems","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g6UdAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":386,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g6UdAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=389&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780201775822","title":"Java Look and Feel Design Guidelines: Advanced Topics","author":"Sun Microsystems","publish_date":"2001","description":"Brand-new techniques for building more effective Java \"TM\" user interfaces. -- Reveals the latest user research by Sun Microsystems! -- Goes beyond the basics with menus, windows, wizards, events, alarms, and much more. -- High-quality 4-color interior!

It includes good coverage of current techniques in code generation and register allocation, as well as the compilation of functional and object-oriented languages, that is missing from most books. The most accepted and successful techniques are described concisely, rather than as an exhaustive catalog of every possible variant, and illustrated with actual Java classes. This second edition has been extensively rewritten to include more discussion of Java and object-oriented programming concepts, such as visitor patterns. A unique feature is the newly redesigned compiler project in Java, for a subset of Java itself. The project includes both front-end and back-end phases, so that students can build a complete working compiler in one semester.","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N-sgAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":null,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N-sgAwAAQBAJ&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":3.5,"ratings_count":4,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N-sgAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=407&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780137084265","title":"The Java EE 6 Tutorial: Basic Concepts","author":"Eric Jendrock, Ian Evans, Devika Gollapudi, Kim Haase, Chinmayee Srivathsa","publish_date":"2010-08-24","description":"The Java EE 6 Tutorial: Basic Concepts, Fourth Edition, is a task-oriented, example-driven guide to developing enterprise applications for the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition 6 (Java EE 6).

Learn how to create intelligent agents that can automate, mediate, and administer basic business functions. Java makes it easier than ever for programmers to build complex agents that reason and learn. In this book, enterprise programming experts Joe and Jennifer Bigus show you how to take advantage of Java's advanced features to differentiate your applications and build the smartest high-powered applications possible. The authors explain the principles of Al program design using Java's object-oriented features and present the essential AI algorithms used to develop agents that reason, model, and learn to adapt to the world around them. They then show how to apply these algorithms and techniques in practical \"real-world\" distributed computing applications. They develop an intelligent agent architecture and use it to construct several agent-enhanced programs, including a PC management agent, an adaptive Internet news reader that filters articles based on user preferences, and an electronic marketplace application where agents do the buying and selling.

Hansen","publish_date":"1999","description":"This is a book about computer programming for everyone: artist, poet, student, doctor, accountant, or engineer. It assumes you know very little or nothing about how computers work. This book will show you how to write understandable computer programs in Java, a programming language widely used on the Internet. Why should you be interested in learning computer programming? Even though most readers will not wish to become professional programmers, programming is fun and useful. You will enjoy learning a new skill and becoming good at it. And, in today's world it is important for professionals in any field to appreciate what computers can (and cannot) do well. To reach this level of understanding, you must go beyond the routine skills of a computer user and learn the art of programming in some depth. While emphasizing general principles of programming, this book: • Uses examples from the humanities only, requiring no math or engineering knowledge. • Explains concepts by means of complete programs. • Concentrates on exercises solved by writing complete programs. • Takes you from text input/output to object-oriented programming in the equivalent of a one-semester class. • Gives you a solid background for a follow-up course on the graphics and networking facilities of Java. This book is a sound and complete introduction to programming and not just another Java reference book for those who already know how to program. Although the book uses Java, the same methods can be used for systematic programming in other languages, such as C, Fortran, and Pascal. The book makes a splendid text for a one-semester course on beginning programming. For such a course, a simple input/output interface is available from the author's website. The author, Professor Per Brinch Hansen, is one of the leading pioneers in computer programming, and his insight and experience make learning proper computer programming in Java fun and easy for everyone.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tBo8WZUTe4kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":238,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tBo8WZUTe4kC&printsec=frontcover&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=474&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780135707890","title":"Java Developer's Resource: A Tutorial and On-line Supplement","author":"Elliotte Rusty Harold","publish_date":"1997-01-01","description":"\"Java Developer's Resource\" shows you how to write full-featured, dynamic, graphical, interactive Java applets and applications, even if you don't have experience with other object-oriented languages.

They realized the need for a comprehensive Java programming tutorial that offers basic programming skills that can be applied in the field of engineering. With this in mind, the authors developed Java Programming for Engineers in order to meet the needs of both engineers and engineering students. The text uses the personal computer as a development platform and assumes no prior programming experience or knowledge. The only skills expected of the reader are basic keyboarding and user-level familiarity with the PC. Topics covered range from mathematical expressions to linear systems to engineering graphics. Chapters on problem solving skills and the designing of engineering applications walk readers through real word problems they might encounter. Divided into two parts, Part 1 is a description of the Java language, of the fundamentals of object orientation, input and output operations, and error handling. Part 2 is about Java programming for engineers. It starts with computer number systems, fixed- and variable-precision numeric data, mathematical programming in Java as could be of interest to engineers, and concludes with an overview of Java Graphics.","publisher":"CRC Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n6heB7tU6SwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":360,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n6heB7tU6SwC&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=496&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781890774653","title":"Murach's Java Programming","author":"Joel Murach","publish_date":"2011","description":"This is the 4th edition of Murach's classic Java book that's trained thousands of developers in the last 10 years.

Here as well sound ideas from the transputer era are being elevated to other processor environments. The book is also an indication to the compiler writers who are concerned with the implementation of multi-threading and CSP principles into contemporary languages.

They realized the need for a comprehensive Java programming tutorial that offers basic programming skills that can be applied in the field of engineering. With this in mind, the authors developed Java Programming for Engineers in order to meet the needs of both engineers and engineering students. The text uses the personal computer as a development platform and assumes no prior programming experience or knowledge. The only skills expected of the reader are basic keyboarding and user-level familiarity with the PC. Topics covered range from mathematical expressions to linear systems to engineering graphics. Chapters on problem solving skills and the designing of engineering applications walk readers through real word problems they might encounter. Divided into two parts, Part 1 is a description of the Java language, of the fundamentals of object orientation, input and output operations, and error handling. Part 2 is about Java programming for engineers. It starts with computer number systems, fixed- and variable-precision numeric data, mathematical programming in Java as could be of interest to engineers, and concludes with an overview of Java Graphics.","publisher":"CRC Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n6heB7tU6SwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":360,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n6heB7tU6SwC&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=530&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781590596258","title":"Foundations of Java for ABAP Programmers","author":"Alistair Rooney","publish_date":"2006-04-04","description":"The only beginning book of its kind, this book will teach you SAP/ABAP developers the skills you need for Java 5 programming.

The language was object oriented, was compiled into an intermediate form called Java Bytecode, and those bytecode instructions were run on a virtual machine called the Java VM. Java, at the time, was a revolution in itself. It quickly became the language of a new generation of software developers who were writing small applications for the web, server applications for the enterprise, and even desktop applications. Today many new languages compile into Java bytecode and are run on top of the Java VM such as Scala, Groovy and Clojure, as well as variants of Python, Ruby, and Erlang. Java is also the language used to write programs for many of the world's mobile devices, including Android. If you're interested in Android development, there is also a bibliography specific to that platform. Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems in January of 2010 and became the owner of the Java technology. So far, this has not changed how Java has been positioned in the market. Open source software projects have used Java extensively to create some of the world's most popular software libraries. These libraries have likely been one of the driving forces behind the creation of many of the JVM based language ports. Of course, people have to learn about how to use these libraries and languages, so the books written about Java are also varied in nature. There are a great many excellent learning reference books, class library reference books, and books on enterprise and web development. There are books that cover the Java Virtual Machine based languages mentioned earlier. The Spring Framework is a highly popular, open source, modular, infinitely configurable framework written in Java that is also covered well by technical book writers. Many games are written in Java, and we've included a few books on Game programming. If you are writing web services, you'll want to read about Service Oriented Architecture as well as storing and retrieving data using one of the many Java persistence frameworks. This bibliography covers the entire Java language, spanning from introductory to advanced topics. We hope you enjoy them and use them to your advantage.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1WU-AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":86,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1WU-AAAAQBAJ&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=535&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781576101216","title":"Web Developer's Guide to Java Beans","author":"Jalal Feghhi","publish_date":"1997","description":"Shows how Java components are designed, created, and used to piece together versatile Web applications, enabling readers to write components, extend them, and distribute them to other developers.

Every developer has a responsibility to author code that is free of significant security vulnerabilities. This book provides realistic guidance to help Java developers implement desired functionality with security, reliability, and maintainability goals in mind.” –Mary Ann Davidson, Chief Security Officer, Oracle Corporation Organizations worldwide rely on Java code to perform mission-critical tasks, and therefore that code must be reliable, robust, fast, maintainable, and secure. Java™ Coding Guidelines brings together expert guidelines, recommendations, and code examples to help you meet these demands. Written by the same team that brought you The CERT® Oracle ® Secure Coding Standard for Java™, this guide extends that previous work’s expert security advice to address many additional quality attributes. You’ll find 75 guidelines, each presented consistently and intuitively. For each guideline, conformance requirements are specified; for most, noncompliant code examples and compliant solutions are also offered. The authors explain when to apply each guideline and provide references to even more detailed information. Reflecting pioneering research on Java security, Java™ Coding Guidelines offers updated techniques for protecting against both deliberate attacks and other unexpected events.

Excerpt: OpenJDK (aka Open Java Development Kit) is a free and open source implementation of the Java programming language. It is the result of an effort Sun Microsystems began in 2006. The implementation is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) with a linking exception, which exempts components of the Java class library from the GPL licensing terms. OpenJDK will become the official Java SE 7 reference implementation. Sun announced in JavaOne 2006 that Java would become open-source software, and on October 25, 2006, at the Oracle OpenWorld conference, Jonathan Schwartz said that the company intended to announce the open-sourcing of the core Java Platform within 30 to 60 days. Sun released the Java HotSpot virtual machine and compiler as free software under the GNU General Public License on November 13, 2006, with a promise that the rest of the JDK (which includes the Java Runtime Environment) would be placed under the GPL by March 2007, \"except for a few components that Sun does not have the right to publish in source form under the GPL.\" According to free-software advocate Richard Stallman, this would end the \"Java trap,\" the vendor lock-in that he argues applied to Java and programs written in Java.

It is part of Java EE 6.0 standards, but can be used in both Java SE and Java EE applications. This is a new Java persistence standard based on object-relational mapping and utilizing object-oriented features of Java. It is expected to gradually replace JDBC and proprietary object-relational mapping frameworks for most Java applications with database access.Using JPA (Java Persistence API) consists of two main tasks. The first task is to map Java classes and their fields/properties to relational database tables and columns. The second task is to manipulate (create, read, update, and delete) Java objects so that the underlying JPA implementation translates Java operations into JDBC calls and executes SQL statements behind the scene. JPA provides many easy-to-use features such as optimistic locking, pessimistic locking, lazy-loading, object caching, bean validation, and listeners for transactional events, which would be daunting tasks for a typical developer to implement when using JDBC. JPA makes software development fun and leads to improved productivity.The book is written for Java developers and architects who know Java programming, but want to learn this new and standard technology. It is also aimed at experienced JPA developers who may use this book as a reference. This book tries to be easy to understand and provides many useful code examples.

The book emphasizes the use of objects and classes from the beginning by providing the basics of OOP from the start, but delaying the complications of the AWT, Swing, and more theoretical concepts of OOP until later. The authors' approach is to design a worker class or support class for each problem. The worker class has data fields for storing the problem inputs and it has methods that implement the algorithm needed to solve the problem. There is a separate application class that instantiates a worker object, passes data to this object, and then displays the results returned by the worker object. In this way, the student is introduced to the importance of object interaction and separation of concerns from the very beginning. The worker class knows how to solve the basic problem (units conversion, computation of area, etc.). The application class knows how to get the data from the user and display it. This approach better prepares students for the use of applets and GUIs. The worker class can be used without modification by an applet that performs the functions of the application class.","publisher":"Addison-Wesley","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vbsEIAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":857,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vbsEIAAACAAJ&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=576&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781449390709","title":"Java: The Good Parts","author":"Jim Waldo","publish_date":"2010-04-20","description":"What if you could condense Java down to its very best features and build better applications with that simpler version?

Excerpt: OpenJDK (aka Open Java Development Kit) is a free and open source implementation of the Java programming language. It is the result of an effort Sun Microsystems began in 2006. The implementation is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) with a linking exception, which exempts components of the Java class library from the GPL licensing terms. OpenJDK will become the official Java SE 7 reference implementation. Sun announced in JavaOne 2006 that Java would become open-source software, and on October 25, 2006, at the Oracle OpenWorld conference, Jonathan Schwartz said that the company intended to announce the open-sourcing of the core Java Platform within 30 to 60 days. Sun released the Java HotSpot virtual machine and compiler as free software under the GNU General Public License on November 13, 2006, with a promise that the rest of the JDK (which includes the Java Runtime Environment) would be placed under the GPL by March 2007, \"except for a few components that Sun does not have the right to publish in source form under the GPL.\" According to free-software advocate Richard Stallman, this would end the \"Java trap,\" the vendor lock-in that he argues applied to Java and programs written in Java.

It is part of Java EE 6.0 standards, but can be used in both Java SE and Java EE applications. This is a new Java persistence standard based on object-relational mapping and utilizing object-oriented features of Java. It is expected to gradually replace JDBC and proprietary object-relational mapping frameworks for most Java applications with database access.Using JPA (Java Persistence API) consists of two main tasks. The first task is to map Java classes and their fields/properties to relational database tables and columns. The second task is to manipulate (create, read, update, and delete) Java objects so that the underlying JPA implementation translates Java operations into JDBC calls and executes SQL statements behind the scene. JPA provides many easy-to-use features such as optimistic locking, pessimistic locking, lazy-loading, object caching, bean validation, and listeners for transactional events, which would be daunting tasks for a typical developer to implement when using JDBC. JPA makes software development fun and leads to improved productivity.The book is written for Java developers and architects who know Java programming, but want to learn this new and standard technology. It is also aimed at experienced JPA developers who may use this book as a reference. This book tries to be easy to understand and provides many useful code examples. Also, it tries to be complete in JPA coverage. It has a special chapter on JPA design patterns and performance tuning. The author hopes to provide a valuable book for novice and experienced JPA developers.http://YangDaoqi.info for information on source code download and errata.","publisher":null,"image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VVPiRgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":376,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VVPiRgAACAAJ&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=595&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781933804330","title":"Java Interview Questions: Java Programming Certification Review","author":"Terry Sanchez","publish_date":"2006-06-01","description":"Much more than a rehash of Sun Java documentation and training materials, and useless \"soft skills\" information, this book contains over 100 technical interview questions that are simply not explored, or not explored as clearly elsewhere.

Bronson","publish_date":"2001-11-13","description":"A FIRST BOOK OF JAVA blends Gary Bronson's successful experience teaching introductory programming courses with key elements students need to know when programming in Java. Like the other books in Bronson's First Book of series, its purpose is to provide students with the tools, techniques, and understanding necessary to create and maintain Java programs at an introductory level. The author takes great care to explain key programming constructs that every beginning student should know, using pedagogy such as aeCommon Programming ErrorsAE sections, end of section exercises to build students skills, and chapter supplement sections that provide enrichment on basic topics. By the time the students complete this book, they will have a strong foundation for learning more advanced features of the Java language. Bronson has taken this proven approach and updated it to incorporate key elements of the Java language. This includes coverage of objects - oriented programming, graphical user interfaces, and event driven programming. These topics are introduced to the students from day one and are developed throughout the text. Since these topics can be complex for the beginning student, Bronson gradually introduces the topics in Part I, while delaying more complex details until later sections. This allows students to fully grasp key programming constructs. The book also provides extensive flexibility depending on how many and when programming concepts and programming techniques are to be introduced. The author has partitioned the text into four parts, allowing professors to pick and choose topics that reflect the goals of their course.\"","publisher":"Brooks/Cole Publishing Company","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dK4CAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":623,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dK4CAAAACAAJ&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=599&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780321197177","title":"Data Abstraction and Problem Solving with Java: Walls and Mirrors","author":"Frank M.

Auszug: A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) enables a set of computer software programs and data structures to use a virtual machine model for the execution of other computer programs and scripts. The model used by a JVM accepts a form of computer intermediate language commonly referred to as Java bytecode. This language conceptually represents the instruction set of a stack-oriented, capability architecture. Sun has claimed there are over 4.5 billion JVM-enabled devices. A JVM can also be used to implement programming languages other than Java. For example, Ada source code can be compiled to Java bytecode, which may then be executed by a JVM.

This book provides a practical introduction to data structures with an emphasis on abstract thinking and problem solving, as well as the use of Java. It does this through what remains a unique approach that clearly separates each data structure's interface (how to use a data structure) from its implementation (how to actually program that structure). Parts I (Tour of Java), II (Algorithms and Building Blocks), and III (Applications) lay the groundwork by discussing basic concepts and tools and providing some practical examples, while Part IV (Implementations) focuses on implementation of data structures. This forces the reader to think about the functionality of the data structures before the hash table is implemented. The Fourth Edition features many new updates as well as new exercises.","publisher":"Addison-Wesley Longman","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=h025GAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":985,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h025GAAACAAJ&dq=java,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=617&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781861005205","title":"Java XML Programmer's Reference","author":"Mohammad Akif, Steven Brodhead, Andrei Cioroianu, Eric Jung, James Hart, Dave Writz","publish_date":"2001","description":"XML is rapidly becoming the standard representation format for data interchange, data verification, configuration, RDBMS interaction, remote procedure invocation, and the representation of transformation processes.
