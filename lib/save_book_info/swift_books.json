[{"isbn":"9780130889843","title":"Accelerating Customer Relationships: Using CRM and Relationship Technologies","author":"Ronald S. Swift","publish_date":"2001","description":"Preface Corporations that achieve high customer retention and high customer profitability aim for: The right product (or service), to the right customer, at the right price, at the right time, through the right channel, to satisfy the customer's need or desire. Information Technology—in the form of sophisticated databases fed by electronic commerce, point-of-sale devices, ATMs, and other customer touch points—is changing the roles of marketing and managing customers. Information and knowledge bases abound and are being leveraged to drive new profitability and manage changing relationships with customers. The creation of knowledge bases, sometimes called data warehouses or Info-Structures, provides profitable opportunities for business managers to define and analyze their customers' behavior to develop and better manage short- and long-term relationships. Relationship Technology will become the new norm for the use of information and customer knowledge bases to forge more meaningful relationships. This will be accomplished through advanced technology, processes centered on the customers and channels, as well as methodologies and software combined to affect the behaviors of organizations (internally) and their customers/channels (externally). We are quickly moving from Information Technology to Relationship Technology. The positive effect will be astounding and highly profitable for those that also foster CRM. At the turn of the century, merchants and bankers knew their customers; they lived in the same neighborhoods and understood the individual shopping and banking needs of each of their customers. They practiced the purest form of Customer Relationship Management (CRM). With mass merchandising and franchising, customer relationships became distant. As the new millennium begins, companies are beginning to leverage IT to return to the CRM principles of the neighborhood store and bank. The customer should be the primary focus for most organizations. Yet customer information in a form suitable for marketing or management purposes either is not available, or becomes available long after a market opportunity passes, therefore CRM opportunities are lost. Understanding customers today is accomplished by maintaining and acting on historical and very detailed data, obtained from numerous computing and point-of-contact devices. The data is merged, enriched, and transformed into meaningful information in a specialized database. In a world of powerful computers, personal software applications, and easy-to-use analytical end-user software tools, managers have the power to segment and directly address marketing opportunities through well managed processes and marketing strategies. This book is written for business executives and managers interested in gaining advantage by using advanced customer information and marketing process techniques. Managers charged with managing and enhancing relationships with their customers will find this book a profitable guide for many years. Many of today's managers are also charged with cutting the cost of sales to increase profitability. All managers need to identify and focus on those customers who are the most profitable, while, possibly, withdrawing from supporting customers who are unprofitable. The goal of this book is to help you: identify actions to categorize and address your customers much more effectively through the use of information and technology, define the benefits of knowing customers more intimately, and show how you can use information to increase turnover/revenues, satisfaction, and profitability. The level of detailed information that companies can build about a single customer now enables them to market through knowledge-based relationships. By defining processes and providing activities, this book will accelerate your CRM \"learning curve,\" and provide an effective framework that will enable your organization to tap into the best practices and experiences of CRM-driven companies (in Chapter 14). In Chapter 6, you will have the opportunity to learn how to (in less than 100 days) start or advance, your customer database or data warehouse environment. This book also provides a wider managerial perspective on the implications of obtaining better information about the whole business. The customer-centric knowledge-based info-structure changes the way that companies do business, and it is likely to alter the structure of the organization, the way it is staffed, and, even, how its management and employees behave. Organizational changes affect the way the marketing department works and the way that it is perceived within the organization. Effective communications with prospects, customers, alliance partners, competitors, the media, and through individualized feedback mechanisms creates a whole new image for marketing and new opportunities for marketing successes. Chapter 14 provides examples of companies that have transformed their marketing principles into CRM practices and are engaging more and more customers in long-term satisfaction and higher per-customer profitability. In the title of this book and throughout its pages I have used the phrase \"Relationship Technologies\" to describe the increasingly sophisticated data warehousing and business intelligence technologies that are helping companies create lasting customer relationships, therefore improving business performance. I want to acknowledge that this phrase was created and protected by NCR Corporation and I use this trademark throughout this book with the company's permission. Special thanks and credit for developing the Relationship Technologies concept goes to Dr. Stephen Emmott of NCR's acclaimed Knowledge Lab in London. As time marches on, there is an ever-increasing velocity with which we communicate, interact, position, and involve our selves and our customers in relationships. To increase your Return on Investment (ROI), the right information and relationship technologies are critical for effective Customer Relationship Management. It is now possible to: know who your customers are and who your best customers are stimulate what they buy or know what they won't buy time when and how they buy learn customers' preferences and make them loyal customers define characteristics that make up a great/profitable customer model channels are best to address a customer's needs predict what they may or will buy in the future keep your best customers for many years This book features many companies using CRM, decision-support, marketing databases, and data-warehousing techniques to achieve a positive ROI, using customer-centric knowledge-bases. Success begins with understanding the scope and processes involved in true CRM and then initiating appropriate actions to create and move forward into the future. Walking the talk differentiates the perennial ongoing winners. Reinvestment in success generates growth and opportunity. Success is in our ability to learn from the past, adopt new ideas and actions in the present, and to challenge the future. Respectfully, Ronald S.

Starting with preparing your Xcode 6.1 IDE and introducing just enough iOS application framework fundamentals, you'll understand how to create meaningful Swift applications for iOS 8 immediately. After the short IDE setup guide, this book continues by providing guidance on how to translate your existing Android apps to iOS. Every topic comes with a tutorial project; you'll plan and structure your iOS apps following a typical top-down process using Xcode Storyboards. To implement use cases, you'll cover common mobile topics, including user interfaces, managing data, and networking with remote services. As you move through Part 2 of this book, you'll create simple and meaningful iOS apps with rich UI components to handle common CRUD operations locally and remotely. Part 3 demonstrates the whole porting process by translating a typical mobile app from Android to iOS 8 from start to finish. When you finish reading Migrating to Swift from Android, you'll be an iOS developer as well as an Android developer.

Apple se preocupó en disminuir la resistencia a la adopción de Swift por los programadores expertos. Para eso, permitió que el nuevo lenguaje utilizara el mismo compilador y pudiera convivir con Objective-C en la misma aplicación. De esa forma, nadie será forzado a aprenderla inmediatamente, ya que es posible continuar programando de la manera tradicional y adoptar la nueva tecnología a los pocos. Pero seguro que ahora nos preguntamos, ¿No era el Objective-C suficientemente bueno? No hay dudas que ese lenguaje es muy poderoso y sirvió a Apple de forma incuestionable durante todos esos años. Sin embargo no es fácil de aprender. El hecho de haber sido construida en base a los lenguajes tradicionales como C creó amarres de compatibilidad que dificultan aún más la comprensión del lenguaje, principalmente para los nuevos programadores.

Using parallel paths to data allows a client to transfer data to and from storage at a higher rate than that supported by a single storage server. We have implemented a network data service, called Swift, that uses data striping. Swift exhibits the expected scaling property in the number of storage servers connected to a network and in the number of interconnection networks present in the system. We have also simulated a version of Swift to explore the limits of possible future configurations. We observe that the system can evolve to support very high speed interconnection networks as well as large numbers of storage servers. Since Swift is a distributed system made up of independently replaceable components, any component that limits the performance can either be replaced by a faster component when it becomes available or can be replicated and used in parallel. This should allow the system to incorporate and exploit emerging storage and networking technologies.\"","publisher":null,"image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qOwoAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":22,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qOwoAQAAIAAJ&q=swift,+subject:computers&dq=swift,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=77&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781484203941","title":"Pro Design Patterns in Swift","author":"Adam Freeman","publish_date":"2015-01-17","description":"The Swift programming language has transformed the world of iOS development and started a new age of modern development.

Object Storage stores data in a flat namespace that scales to trillions of objects. The design of object storage also simplifies how users access data, supporting new types of applications and allowing users to access data by a variety of methods, including mobile devices and web applications. Data distribution and management are also simplified, allowing greater collaboration across the globe. OpenStack Swift is an emerging open-source object storage software platform that is widely used for cloud storage. Elastic Storage, based on IBM® General Parallel File System (GPFSTM) technology, is a high-performance and proven product that is used to store the data for thousands of mission-critical commercial installations worldwide. (Throughout this IBM RedpaperTM publication, Elastic Storage is used to refer to GPFS 4.1.) Elastic Storage also automates common storage management tasks, such as Tiering and Archiving at scale. Together, Elastic Storage and OpenStack Swift provide an enterprise-class object storage solution that efficiently stores, distributes, and retains critical data. This paper provides instructions about how to set up and configure Swift with Elastic Storage. It also provides an initial set of preferred practices to ensure optimal performance and reliability. The goal of this paper is to describe the benefits of using GPFS as the underlying file system with OpenStack Swift, guide the administrator through the installation and configuration of Elastic Storage Object, and describe the general set of configurations and scenarios that have been validated. It is intended for administrators who are familiar with GPFS and OpenStack Swift components.","publisher":"IBM Redbooks","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yK6jBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":104,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yK6jBAAAQBAJ&dq=swift,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=82&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781785283239","title":"iOS Game Development By Example","author":"Samanyu Chopra","publish_date":"2015-08-27","description":"Learn how to develop an ace game for your iOS device, using Sprite Kit About This Book Learn about the Sprite Kit engine and create games on the iOS platform from the ground up Acquaint your Sprite Kit knowledge with Swift programming and turn your 2D game conceptualization into reality in no time An abridged and focused guide to develop an exhaustive mobile game Who This Book Is For This book is for beginners who want to start their game development odyssey in the iOS platform.

The International Conference on Web Reasoning and Rule Systems (RR) was founded to address these needs and has grown into a major international forum in this area. The third RR conference was held during October 25–26, 2009 in Chantilly, Virginia, co-located with the International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2009). This year 41 papers were submitted from authors in 21 countries. The P- gram Committee performed outstandingly to ensure that each paper submitted to RR 2009 was thoroughly reviewed by at least three referees in a short - riod of time. The resulting conference presented papers of high quality on many of the key issues for reasoning on the Semantic Web. RR 2009 was fortunate to have two distinguished invited speakers. Robert Kowalski, in his talk “- tegrating Logic Programming and Production Systems with Abductive Logic Programming Agents” addressed some of the fundamental considerations - hind reasoning about evolving systems. Benjamin Grossof’s talk “SILK: Higher Level Rules with Defaults and Semantic Scalability” described the design of a major next-generation rule system.

Westwood, R.S. Haluck, H.M. Hoffman","publish_date":"2006-01-04","description":"Machine intelligence will eclipse human intelligence within the next few decades - extrapolating from Moore’s Law - and our world will enjoy limitless computational power and ubiquitous data networks. Today’s iPod® devices portend an era when biology and information technology will fuse to create a human experience radically different from our own. Already, our healthcare system now appears on the verge of crisis; accelerating change is part of the problem. Each technological upgrade demands an investment of education and money, and a costly infrastructure more quickly becomes obsolete. Practitioners can be overloaded with complexity: therapeutic options, outcomes data, procedural coding, drug names etc. Furthermore, an aging global population with a growing sense of entitlement demands that each medical breakthrough be immediately available for its benefit: what appears in the morning paper is expected simultaneously in the doctor’s office. Meanwhile, a third-party payer system generates conflicting priorities for patient care and stockholder returns. The result is a healthcare system stressed by scientific promise, public expectation, economic and regulatory constraints and human limitations. Change is also proving beneficial, of course. Practitioners are empowered by better imaging methods, more precise robotic tools, greater realism in training simulators, and more powerful intelligence networks. The remarkable accomplishments of the IT industry and the Internet are trickling steadily into healthcare. The Medicine Meets Virtual Reality series can readily see the progress of the past fourteen years: more effective healthcare at a lower overall cost, driven by cheaper and better computers.","publisher":"IOS Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VwDvAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":620,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VwDvAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA240&dq=swift,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=120&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9783642414855","title":"Critical Information Infrastructures Security: 7th International Workshop, CRITIS 2012, Lillehammer, Norway, September 17-18, 2012.

Blair, Terry Nichols, David Burns, John R. Curnutt","publish_date":"2013-06-12","description":"The Columbine tragedy on April 20, 1999 began a new era in law enforcement as it became apparent that the police response to such mass shootings must be drastically altered. By the time the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting occurred on December 14, 2012, outdated police response strategies had been replaced with new, aggressive tactics used by the first officers on the scene. The frequency with which these events occur remind us time and again about the importance of training and preparing for these critical situations before they occur in our own backyards. Active Shooter Events and Response is one of the first attempts to not only discuss historic active shooter events, but also to actually dissect some of them—empowering law enforcement professionals by leveraging the essential knowledge and experience of those who have gone before us. The book also offers insight into the training methodologies and strategies used to prepare our nation’s first responders to address the active shooter threat. In addition, the authors discuss the clear and present threat of terrorist organizations using these mass shooter tactics on American soil—similar to the attacks in Beslan, Russia and Mumbai, India. Written by members of the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training (ALERRT) Center at Texas State University, this book is the culmination of more than a decade’s worth of training and research into active shooter events and represents state-of-the-art, evidence-based best practices.","publisher":"CRC Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qL_MBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":264,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qL_MBQAAQBAJ&dq=swift,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qL_MBQAAQBAJ&pg=PR11&dq=swift,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=130&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780884080473","title":"Computer Science for the Teacher","author":"James L.

Structure-based computational approaches are necessary to recognize and characterize protein-protein complexes and their functions. It introduces the idea that for specific proteins, homology modeling is the most effective technique and that docking algorithms are an increasingly powerful tool for providing a detailed explanation of such interactions. This book is a useful source of information on biomass-based biofuels for researchers in the field of bio-hydrogen and bioinformatics techniques. Biofuel and bioenergy produced from unicellular microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a clean energy source and providing information about functional optimization in HydA1 and PetF interactions will help researchers to adopt swift screening methods to identify key protein complexes and their functions. The book also provides an introduction to hydrogenases and associated Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which is a useful model microorganism for research on biofuel production. The book focuses on the in silico methods such as phylogenetic studies, homology modeling, molecular docking, electrostatic studies and conformational analysis, which have the potential to become the most cost-effective methods for bio-fuel production.

Service and equipment providers are queuing to meet these needs. This book is a result of ISSLS 91, a forum for reconciling supply and demand. The overall theme of the conference was Moving to the User , with sub-themes of Communication in Business, Secure and Dependable Services, Operations and Management, and Access Architectures and Technologies. ISSLS has for many years been dominated by the impact of network digitalization as it spreads into the local access network, particularly in the form of ISDN. The technology in this area has been maturing and the new challenge is to identify the ways digitalization can be exploited, both by the users for new applications, and by the network provider for making networks more manageable, resilient, flexible and cost-effective. Radio coupled with digital processing and control is now a major force, giving the opportunity for wireless operation on scales varying between the cordless telephone and the rapid provision of services in rural areas. For many purposes, the major challenge of radio lies in living with its limited bandwidth. This is not the case with optical fibres, where bandwidths generally exceed all needs, and the challenge lies in launching and receiving signals in a cost-effective way, and by sharing between multiple users. At ISSLS 88 proposals were made for passive optical networks (PONs). Since then much study has been put into these and other techniques and the progress and problems are reported in this book.","publisher":"North Holland","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wSofAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":440,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wSofAQAAIAAJ&q=swift,+subject:computers&dq=swift,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=160&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780671731083","title":"Screamers","author":"Franklin W.

Dietz, Antonia Albani","publish_date":"2008-06-10","description":"The expectation for the future of the 21st century enterprise is complexity and agility. In this digital age, business processes are scattered not only throu- out the labyrinth of their own enterprises, but also across di?erent enterprises, and even beyond the national boundaries. An evidence of this is the gr- ing phenomenon of business process outsourcing. Increasing competition, higher customer demands, and emerging technologies require swift adaptation to the changes. To understand, design, and engineer a modern enterprise (or an enterprise network) and its interwoven business processes, an engineering and systematic approach based on sound and rigorous theories and methodologies is necessary. Along with that, a paradigmshift seems to be needed for addressing these issues adequately. An appealing candidate is to look at an enterprise and its business processes as a social system. In its social setting, an enterprise and its bu- ness processes represent actors with certain authorities and assigned roles, who assume certain responsibilities in order to provide a service to its environment. The need for this paradigm shift along with the complexity and agility of modern enterprises, gives inspiration for the emerging discipline of Enterprise Engineering. For the study of this socio-technical phenomenon, the prominent tools ofModeling andSimulation play a signi?cant role.Both (conceptual) m- eling and simulationare widely used for understanding,analyzing,andengine- ing an enterprise (its organization and business processes).","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SVe2yzG8pu4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":195,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SVe2yzG8pu4C&dq=swift,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SVe2yzG8pu4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=swift,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=171&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780764537110","title":"Flash MX 3D Graphics Bible","author":"Matthew David","publish_date":"2003-05-09","description":"* Macromedia Flash MX is the world's hottest Web development tool, with more than 500 million users and one million designer/developers * Covers essential information for Flash developers who are developing games, marketing materials, training materials, and more * Shows how to create 3D Flash applications using Flash's built-in tools, plug-ins, Swift 3D, Plazma 3D, Discrete 3D, and other leading products that export to the Flash format * CD-ROM includes scores of examples from the book, plus tryouts of Flash and leading Flash 3D applications","publisher":"Wiley","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KOlrSr3D6PMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":762,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KOlrSr3D6PMC&q=swift,+subject:computers&dq=swift,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=172&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781591401353","title":"Organizational Data Mining: Leveraging Enterprise Data Resources for Optimal Performance","author":"Hamid R.

These organizations collect data from multiple sources, both internal and external. These sources include legacy systems, customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning applications, online and e-commerce systems, government organizations and business suppliers and partners. A recent study from the University of California at Berkeley found the amount of data organizations collect and store in enterprise databases doubles every year, and slightly more than half of this data will consist of \"reference information,\" which is the kind of information strategic business applications and decision support systems demand (Kestelyn, 2002). Terabyte-sized (1,000 megabytes) databases are commonplace in organizations today, and this enormous growth will make petabyte-sized databases (1,000 terabytes) a reality within the next few years (Whiting, 2002). By 2004 the Gartner Group estimates worldwide data volumes will be 30 times those of 1999, which translates into more data having been produced in the last 30 years than during the previous 5,000 (Wurman, 1989).","publisher":"IGI Global","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EXh4GqN27LoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":371,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EXh4GqN27LoC&dq=swift,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EXh4GqN27LoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=swift,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=173&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781782167594","title":"OpenStack Cloud Computing Cookbook Second Edition","author":"Kevin Jackson, Cody Bunch","publish_date":"2013-10-17","description":"A Cookbook full of practical and applicable recipes that will enable you to use the full capabilities of OpenStack like never before.This book is aimed at system administrators and technical architects moving from a virtualized environment to cloud environments with familiarity of cloud computing platforms.

Now in its fourth edition, the book is enhanced to cover the very latest developments in SQL Server, including the in-memory features that are introduced in SQL Server 2014. Within the book, there are plenty of examples of tasks that developers routinely perform. You’ll learn to create tables and indexes, and be introduced to best practices for securing your valuable data. You’ll learn design tradeoffs and find out how to make sound decisions resulting in scalable databases and maintainable code. SQL Server 2014 introduces in-memory tables and stored procedures. It's now possible to accelerate applications by creating tables (and their indexes) that reside entirely in memory, and never on disk. These new, in-memory structures differ from caching mechanisms of the past, and make possible the extraordinarily swift execution of certain types of queries such as are used in business intelligence applications. Beginning SQL Server for Developers helps you realize the promises of this new feature set while avoiding pitfalls that can occur when mixing in-memory tables and code with traditional, disk-based tables and code. Beginning SQL Server for Developers takes you through the entire database development process, from installing the software to creating a database to writing the code to connect to that database and move data in and out.

The issues being faced by the business commanders of today are rapidly becoming more complex. Veritable waves of information are crashing down on organizational decision makers. While the environment is becoming more complex, it is getting tougher to discern the relevant information from among the flood of available data. The demand for accurate, rapid decision making is impelling today's decision makers to wonder about the existence of some sort of job-preserving assistance. These decision makers are often awash in political controversy as well as technical, economic, social, and legal considerations. Relief from this sea of troubles may come from a behaviorally-responsive decision support system (DSS) in the form of computer assistance that considers the decision maker's cognitive and emotional needs. This book describes a DSS that will meet the needs of modern organization decision makers.","publisher":"Greenwood Publishing Group","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ldGv1sGKgxQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":172,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ldGv1sGKgxQC&dq=swift,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ldGv1sGKgxQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=swift,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=190&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"Information technologies for the control of money laundering","author":"United States. Congress. Office of Technology Assessment","publish_date":"1995","description":"The key to control of international crime may depend on cutting off the flow of illegal profits to criminal organizations. It is estimated that $300 billion of dirty money may be laundered each year, its origin and ownership obscured as it passes through financial institutions and across national boundaries in an effort to hide and protect it from law enforcement authorities. Criminal organizations, like legitimate businesses, enjoy a swift and nearly risk free conduit for moving money between countries wire transfer systems. Illicit wire transfers are easily hidden among the 700,000 mostly legitimate wire transfers that occur daily in the United States, moving well over $2 trillion. OTA was asked by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs to assess the proposed use of techniques derived from artificial intelligence research to monitor wire transfer traffic and recognize suspicious transfers. Fully automated computer screening of wire transfers was found to be virtually impossible for technical reasons. However, OTA analysts developed and evaluated a number of alternative configurations of technology that, combined with certain legal and institutional innovations, could greatly enhance the capability of law enforcement agencies to detect and prosecute money launders seeking to exploit U.S. financial institutions and wire transfer systems. Although all of these proposed configurations entail some economic and social costs, including possible diminution of financial privacy, strategies are suggested for minimizing these costs while enhancing the potential usefulness of information technology in control of money laundering.","publisher":"Congress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TPdkrX2qkEAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":144,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TPdkrX2qkEAC&q=swift,+subject:computers&dq=swift,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=191&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781484215166","title":"Learn WatchKit for WatchOS 2","author":"Kim Topley","publish_date":"2015-11-04","description":"Learn WatchKit for watchOS 2 covers the development of applications for the new Apple Watch using the WatchKit framework in iOS 9 and watchOS 2 and the Swift 2 programming language.","publisher":"aPress","image_url":null,"total_pages":500,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KNgeswEACAAJ&dq=swift,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=192&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"Electronic Funds Transfer: Oversight of Critical Banking Systems Should be Strengthened : Report to the Chairman, Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives","author":"United States.

With barriers to start a company being lowered every day, the rapid influx of new startups throughout every industry, and the constant chaos from within existing organizations, logic and sound decision making are commonly replaced with swift moving actions with only the short-term in mind. Decision makers are constantly moving to make businesses simpler, more fluid, more agile, and better. In this disaster of chaos one simple concept is easily left behind: thought. More specifically, what gets left behind is forethought. In The Scalability Coefficient, software expert and entrepreneur Trevor Hall outlines a new method of analyzing your business so you can accommodate the steady pace of modern business, while pushing your organization to success with complete, thoughtful decisions based off facts. Through the design of this engineering-centric method of business analysis, Trevor will describe the method of dissecting and organizing your business into its most atomic pieces and how to logically rebuild your thoughts as a holistic unit. By creating an organization's \"Scalability Coefficient,\" you will have a new tool based directly off the facts that shape your company. And with that tool, you can make swift decisions to gain the highest level of efficiency both for the short-term while always considering the long-term visions and goals. Following an example of a fictitious business through the analysis, The Scalability Coefficient will describe the concepts through practical application which you can then apply to any company, team, or project. It demonstrates the complexities of a seemingly simple company by disassembling it into logical pieces, them piecing it back together with logic and thought, forming its custom \"Scalability Coefficient\" along the way. The end takeaway being the Coefficient, which acts as a fact-driven formula for driving critical business decisions.","publisher":null,"image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JcWXnQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":318,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JcWXnQEACAAJ&dq=swift,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=197&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"Come guadagnare grazie ad Amazon: ","author":"Luca Cosmi","publish_date":"2015-08-04","description":"Questa breve guida ti insegnerà a guadagnare online grazie ad Amazon e al suo programma pubblicitario.

Assuming a basic knowledge of Flash, the book gives you a thorough grounding in ActionScripting techniques, teaches you the basics of a myriad of scripting languages and their Flash interaction capabilities, discusses and implements client-side/server-side interaction, explains the middleware that can make your life considerably easier (Ultradev, Generator, Swift Generator, ASP Turbine), and demonstrates database interaction and usability (Access, SQL, and MYSQL). To conclude this admittedly tough but not prohibitive learning curve, the book walks you through a selection of fairly generic real world case studies, using Flash with middleware and database connectivity, demonstrating how these elements come together to give you truly dynamic, interactive Flash sites. This book is about visual richness and utility. This Web business is getting beautiful, and Flash is getting useful. What you’ll learnWho this book is for Flash 5 Dynamic Content Studio addresses the growing market of web artists under pressure to learn the finer points of interactive design with Flash 5. This book demonstrates the best tools for integrating dynamic content using a Flash front-end. Readers will see how to link Flash movies, via a middleware bridge, through to a back-end datastores (images and/or text). This book assumes that the reader already knows the fundamentals of creating Flash movies, but doesn't assume any programming knowledge at all. The book covers ActionScripting, (of course!), ASP, PHP, JSP, Perl, CGI, Cold Fusion, Macromedia Generator, ASP Turbine, Swift Generator, and Macromedia Ultradev.","publisher":"friendsofED","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zBsdQ_KPJJMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":648,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zBsdQ_KPJJMC&dq=swift,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=207&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780738439112","title":"Financial Transaction Manager Technical Overview","author":"Craig Bryce, Sean Dunne, Prasad Edlabadkar, Peter McGrath, Sandesh Udupa, IBM Redbooks","publish_date":"2014-03-21","description":"Dramatic forces of change continue to sweep the financial services industry.

Damit diese beeindruckende Entwicklung weiter anhält, müssen Lösungen eingesetzt werden, die Kommunikationsprozesse zwischen Geschäftspartnern fördern und effizient machen. Eine große Herausforderung ist dabei der zwischenbetriebliche, weil grenzüber-schreitende Austausch von Geschäftsdokumenten. Über diese Grenzen hinweg müssen Prozesse koordiniert und automatisiert werden. Ziel der Unternehmen ist es die Effizienz und Qualität der Prozesse zu steigern und die Kosten zu senken. Eine Möglichkeit wie dies zu erreichen ist, ist die Vernetzung der Anwendungs¬systeme in den Unternehmen um Geschäftsprozesse über die Unternehmensgrenzen hinweg zu automatisieren. Kundenanfragen, Angebot, Auftrag, Lieferung, und Rechnung stellen viele Geschäftsdokumente dar, jedes dieser einzelnen Dokumente wird bei einem Wechsel des Anwendungssystems wieder neu erfasst, obwohl sie inhaltlich gleich sind. Solche Medienbrüche sind sehr unwirtschaftlich und fehler¬behaftet. Deshalb kann aus einer automatischen elektronischen Weitergabe und Verarbeitung der Dokumente und Daten Vorteile gezogen werden. Um den bei der Abwicklung dieser Transaktionen entstehenden Koordinations¬aufwand zu verringern haben es sich zahlreiche Initiativen und Unternehmens¬kooperationen zur Aufgabe gemacht, Standards zu entwickeln, die Interoperabilität herstellen. Diese unterscheiden sich bezüglich ihres Ansatzes und ihres funktionalen Umfangs.

Book and literature review is ideal for sun and moon tracking in solar applications for sun-rich countries such as the USA, Spain, Portugal, Mediterranean, Italy, Greece, Mexico, Portugal, China, India, Brazil, Chili, Argentina, South America, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Middle East, Iran, Iraq, etc. A solar tracker is a device that orients a payload toward the sun. Like a satellite tracker or moon tracker, it tracks the celestial object in the sky on its orbital path of apparent movement. A programmable computer based solar tracking device includes principles of solar tracking, solar tracking systems, as well as microcontroller, microprocessor and/or PC based solar tracking control to orientate solar reflectors, solar lenses, photovoltaic panels or other optical configurations towards the sun. Motorized space frames and kinematic systems ensure motion dynamics and employ drive technology and gearing principles to steer optical configurations such as mangin, parabolic, conic, or cassegrain solar energy collectors to face the sun and follow the sun movement contour continuously. In harnessing power from the sun through a solar tracker or practical solar tracking system, renewable energy control automation systems require automatic solar tracking software and solar position algorithms to accomplish dynamic motion control with control automation architecture, circuit boards and hardware. On-axis sun tracking system such as the altitude-azimuth dual axis or multi-axis solar tracker systems use a sun tracking algorithm or ray tracing sensors or software to ensure the sun's passage through the sky is traced with high precision in automated solar tracker applications, right through summer solstice, solar equinox and winter solstice. From sun tracing software perspective, the sonnet Tracing The Sun has a literal meaning. Within the context of sun track and trace, this book explains that the sun's daily path across the sky is directed by relatively simple principles, and if grasped/understood, then it is relatively easy to trace the sun with sun following software. Sun position computer software for tracing the sun are available as open source code, sources that is listed in this book. Ironically there was even a system called sun chaser, said to have been a solar positioner system known for chasing the sun throughout the day. Using solar equations in an electronic circuit for solar tracking is quite simple, even if you are a novice, but mathematical solar equations are over complicated by academic experts and professors in text-books, journal articles and internet websites. In terms of solar hobbies, scholars, students and Hobbyist's looking at solar tracking electronics or PC programs for solar tracking are usually overcome by the sheer volume of scientific material and internet resources, which leaves many developers in frustration when search for simple experimental solar tracking source-code for their on-axis sun-tracking systems. This booklet will simplify the search for the mystical sun tracking formulas for your sun tracker innovation and help you develop your own autonomous solar tracking controller. By directing the solar collector directly into the sun, a solar harvesting means or device can harness sunlight or thermal heat. This is achieved with the help of sun angle formulas, solar angle formulas or solar tracking procedures for the calculation of sun's position in the sky. Automatic sun tracking system software includes algorithms for solar altitude azimuth angle calculations required in following the sun across the sky. In using the longitude, latitude GPS coordinates of the solar tracker location, these sun tracking software tools supports precision solar tracking by determining the solar altitude-azimuth coordinates for the sun trajectory in altitude-azimuth tracking at the tracker location, using certain sun angle formulas in sun vector calculations. Instead of follow the sun software, a sun tracking sensor such as a sun sensor or webcam or video camera with vision based sun following image processing software can also be used to determine the position of the sun optically. Such optical feedback devices are often used in solar panel tracking systems and dish tracking systems. Dynamic sun tracing is also used in solar surveying, DNI analyser and sun surveying systems that build solar infographics maps with solar radiance, irradiance and DNI models for GIS (geographical information system). In this way geospatial methods on solar/environment interaction makes use use of geospatial technologies (GIS, Remote Sensing, and Cartography).Climatic data and weather station or weather center data, as well as queries from sky servers and solar resource database systems (i.e. on DB2, Sybase, Oracle, SQL, MySQL) may also be associated with solar GIS maps. In such solar resource modelling systems, a pyranometer or solarimeter is normally used in addition to measure direct and indirect, scattered, dispersed, reflective radiation for a particular geographical location. Sunlight analysis is important in flash photography where photographic lighting are important for photographers. GIS systems are used by architects who add sun shadow applets to study architectural shading or sun shadow analysis, solar flux calculations, optical modelling or to perform weather modelling. Such systems often employ a computer operated telescope type mechanism with ray tracing program software as a solar navigator or sun tracer that determines the solar position and intensity. The purpose of this booklet is to assist developers to track and trace suitable source-code and solar tracking algorithms for their application, whether a hobbyist, scientist, technician or engineer. Many open-source sun following and tracking algorithms and source-code for solar tracking programs and modules are freely available to download on the internet today. Certain proprietary solar tracker kits and solar tracking controllers include a software development kit SDK for its application programming interface API attributes (Pebble). Widget libraries, widget toolkits, GUI toolkit and UX libraries with graphical control elements are also available to construct the graphical user interface (GUI) for your solar tracking or solar power monitoring program. The solar library used by solar position calculators, solar simulation software and solar contour calculators include machine program code for the solar hardware controller which are software programmed into Micro-controllers, Programmable Logic Controllers PLC, programmable gate arrays, Arduino processor or PIC processor. PC based solar tracking is also high in demand using C++, Visual Basic VB, as well as MS Windows, Linux and Apple Mac based operating systems for sun path tables on Matlab, Excel. Some books and internet webpages use other terms, such as: sun angle calculator, sun position calculator or solar angle calculator. As said, such software code calculate the solar azimuth angle, solar altitude angle, solar elevation angle or the solar Zenith angle (Zenith solar angle is simply referenced from vertical plane, the mirror of the elevation angle measured from the horizontal or ground plane level). Similar software code is also used in solar calculator apps or the solar power calculator apps for IOS and Android smartphone devices. Most of these smartphone solar mobile apps show the sun path and sun-angles for any location and date over a 24 hour period. Some smartphones include augmented reality features in which you can physically see and look at the solar path through your cell phone camera or mobile phone camera at your phone's specific GPS location. In the computer programming and digital signal processing (DSP) environment, (free/open source) program code are available for VB, .Net, Delphi, Python, C, C+, C++, Swift, ADM, F, Flash, Basic, QBasic, GBasic, KBasic, SIMPL language, Squirrel, Solaris, Assembly language on operating systems such as MS Windows, Apple Mac, DOS or Linux OS. Software algorithms predicting position of the sun in the sky are commonly available as graphical programming platforms such as Matlab (Mathworks), Simulink models, Java applets, TRNSYS simulations, Scada system apps, Labview module, Beckhoff TwinCAT (Visual Studio), Siemens SPA, mobile and iphone apps, Android or iOS tablet apps, and so forth. At the same time, PLC software code for a range of sun tracking automation technology can follow the profile of sun in sky for Siemens, HP, Panasonic, ABB, Allan Bradley, OMRON, SEW, Festo, Beckhoff, Rockwell, Schneider, Endress Hauser, Fudji electric. Honeywell, Fuchs, Yokonawa, or Muthibishi platforms. Sun path projection software are also available for a range of modular IPC embedded PC motherboards, Industrial PC, PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) and PAC (Programmable Automation Controller) such as the Siemens S7-1200 or Siemens Logo, Beckhoff IPC or CX series, OMRON PLC, Ercam PLC, AC500plc ABB, National Instruments NI PXI or NI cRIO, PIC processor, Intel 8051/8085, IBM (Cell, Power, Brain or Truenorth series), FPGA (Xilinx Altera Nios), Xeon, Atmel megaAVR, or Arduino AtMega microcontroller, with servo motor, stepper motor, direct current DC pulse width modulation PWM (current driver) or alternating current AC SPS or IPC variable frequency drives VFD motor drives (also termed adjustable-frequency drive, variable-speed drive, AC drive, micro drive or inverter drive) for electrical, mechatronic, pneumatic, or hydraulic solar tracking actuators. The above motion control and robot control systems include analogue or digital interfacing ports on the processors to allow for tracker angle orientation feedback control through one or a combination of angle sensor or angle encoder, shaft encoder, precision encoder, optical encoder, magnetic encoder, direction encoder, rotational encoder, chip encoder, tilt sensor, inclination sensor, or pitch sensor. Note that the tracker's elevation or zenith axis angle may measured using an altitude angle-, declination angle-, inclination angle-, pitch angle-, or vertical angle-, zenith angle- sensor or inclinometer. Similarly the tracker's azimuth axis angle be measured with a azimuth angle-, horizontal angle-, or roll angle- sensor. Chip integrated accelerometer magnetometer gyroscope type angle sensors can also be used to calculate displacement. Other options include the use of thermal imaging systems such as a Fluke thermal imager, or robotic or vision based solar tracker systems that employ face tracking, head tracking, hand tracking, eye tracking and car tracking principles in solar tracking. With unattended decentralised rural, island, isolated, or autonomous off-grid power installations, remote control, monitoring, data acquisition, digital datalogging and online measurement and verification equipment becomes crucial. It assists the operator with supervisory control to monitor the efficiency of remote renewable energy resources and systems and provide valuable web-based feedback in terms of CO2 and clean development mechanism (CDM) reporting. A power quality analyser for diagnostics through internet, WiFi and cellular mobile links is most valuable in frontline troubleshooting and predictive maintenance, where quick diagnostic analysis is required to detect and prevent power quality issues. Solar tracker applications cover a wide spectrum of solar energy and concentrated solar devices, including solar power generation, solar desalination, solar water purification, solar steam generation, solar electricity generation, solar industrial process heat, solar thermal heat storage, solar food dryers, solar water pumping, hydrogen production from methane or producing hydrogen and oxygen from water (HHO) through electrolysis. Many patented or non-patented solar apparatus include tracking in solar apparatus for solar electric generator, solar desalinator, solar steam engine, solar ice maker, solar water purifier, solar cooling, solar refrigeration, USB solar charger, solar phone charging, portable solar charging tracker, solar coffee brewing, solar cooking or solar dying means. Your project may be the next breakthrough or patent, but your invention is held back by frustration in search for the sun tracker you require for your solar powered appliance, solar generator, solar tracker robot, solar freezer, solar cooker, solar drier, solar pump, solar freezer, or solar dryer project. Whether your solar electronic circuit diagram include a simplified solar controller design in a solar electricity project, solar power kit, solar hobby kit, solar steam generator, solar hot water system, solar ice maker, solar desalinator, hobbyist solar panels, hobby robot, or if you are developing professional or hobby electronics for a solar utility or micro scale solar powerplant for your own solar farm or solar farming, this publication may help accelerate the development of your solar tracking innovation. Lately, solar polygeneration, solar trigeneration (solar triple generation), and solar quad generation (adding delivery of steam, liquid/gaseous fuel, or capture food-grade CO$_2$) systems have need for automatic solar tracking. These systems are known for significant efficiency increases in energy yield as a result of the integration and re-use of waste or residual heat and are suitable for compact packaged micro solar powerplants that could be manufactured and transported in kit-form and operate on a plug-and play basis. Typical hybrid solar power systems include compact or packaged solar micro combined heat and power (CHP or mCHP) or solar micro combined, cooling, heating and power (CCHP, CHPC, mCCHP, or mCHPC) systems used in distributed power generation. These systems are often combined in concentrated solar CSP and CPV smart microgrid configurations for off-grid rural, island or isolated microgrid, minigrid and distributed power renewable energy systems. Solar tracking algorithms are also used in modelling of trigeneration systems using Matlab and Simulink platform as well as in automation and control of renewable energy systems through intelligent parsing, multi-objective, adaptive learning control and control optimization strategies. Solar tracking algorithms also find application in developing solar models for country or location specific solar studies, for example in terms of measuring or analysis of the fluctuations of the solar radiation (i.e. direct and diffuse radiation) in a particular area. Solar DNI, solar irradiance and atmospheric information and models can thus be integrated into a solar map, solar atlas or geographical information systems (GIS). Such models allows for defining local parameters for specific regions that may be valuable in terms of the evaluation of different solar in photovoltaic of CSP systems on simulation and synthesis platforms such as Matlab and Simulink or in linear or multi-objective optimization algorithm platforms such as COMPOSE, EnergyPLAN or DER-CAM. A dual-axis solar tracker and single-axis solar tracker may use a sun tracker program or sun tracker algorithm to position a solar dish, solar panel array, heliostat array, PV panel, solar antenna or infrared solar nantenna. A self-tracking solar concentrator performs automatic solar tracking by computing the solar vector. Solar position algorithms (TwinCAT, SPA, or PSA Algorithms) use an astronomical algorithm to calculate the position of the sun. It uses astronomical software algorithms and equations for solar tracking in the calculation of sun's position in the sky for each location on the earth at any time of day. Like an optical solar telescope, the solar position algorithm pin-points the solar reflector at the sun and locks onto the sun's position to track the sun across the sky as the sun progresses throughout the day. Optical sensors such as photodiodes, light-dependant-resistors (LDR) or photoresistors are used as optical accuracy feedback devices. Lately we also included a section in the book (with links to microprocessor code) on how the PixArt Wii infrared camera in the Wii remote or Wiimote may be used in infrared solar tracking applications. In order to harvest free energy from the sun, some automatic solar positioning systems use an optical means to direct the solar tracking device. These solar tracking strategies use optical tracking techniques, such as a sun sensor means, to direct sun rays onto a silicon or CMOS substrate to determine the X and Y coordinates of the sun's position. In a solar mems sun-sensor device, incident sunlight enters the sun sensor through a small pin-hole in a mask plate where light is exposed to a silicon substrate. In a web-camera or camera image processing sun tracking and sun following means, object tracking software performs multi object tracking or moving object tracking methods. In an solar object tracking technique, image processing software performs mathematical processing to box the outline of the apparent solar disc or sun blob within the captured image frame, while sun-localization is performed with an edge detection algorithm to determine the solar vector coordinates. An automated positioning system help maximize the yields of solar power plants through solar tracking control to harness sun's energy. In such renewable energy systems, the solar panel positioning system uses a sun tracking techniques and a solar angle calculator in positioning PV panels in photovoltaic systems and concentrated photovoltaic CPV systems. Automatic on-axis solar tracking in a PV solar tracking system can be dual-axis sun tracking or single-axis sun solar tracking. It is known that a motorized positioning system in a photovoltaic panel tracker increase energy yield and ensures increased power output, even in a single axis solar tracking configuration. Other applications such as robotic solar tracker or robotic solar tracking system uses robotica with artificial intelligence in the control optimization of energy yield in solar harvesting through a robotic tracking system. Automatic positioning systems in solar tracking designs are also used in other free energy generators, such as concentrated solar thermal power CSP and dish Stirling systems. The sun tracking device in a solar collector in a solar concentrator or solar collector Such a performs on-axis solar tracking, a dual axis solar tracker assists to harness energy from the sun through an optical solar collector, which can be a parabolic mirror, parabolic reflector, Fresnel lens or mirror array/matrix. A parabolic dish or reflector is dynamically steered using a transmission system or solar tracking slew drive mean. In steering the dish to face the sun, the power dish actuator and actuation means in a parabolic dish system optically focusses the sun's energy on the focal point of a parabolic dish or solar concentrating means. A Stirling engine, solar heat pipe, thermosyphin, solar phase change material PCM receiver, or a fibre optic sunlight receiver means is located at the focal point of the solar concentrator. The dish Stirling engine configuration is referred to as a dish Stirling system or Stirling power generation system. Hybrid solar power systems (used in combination with biogas, biofuel, petrol, ethanol, diesel, natural gas or PNG) use a combination of power sources to harness and store solar energy in a storage medium. Any multitude of energy sources can be combined through the use of controllers and the energy stored in batteries, phase change material, thermal heat storage, and in cogeneration form converted to the required power using thermodynamic cycles (organic Rankin, Brayton cycle, micro turbine, Stirling) with an inverter and charge controller. 这本书详细介绍了全自动太阳能跟踪，太阳跟踪系统的出现，太阳能跟踪器和太阳跟踪系统。智能全自动太阳能跟踪器是定向向着太阳的有效载荷设备。这种可编程计算机的太阳能跟踪装置，包括太阳跟踪，太阳能跟踪系统，以及微控制器，微处理器和/或基于PC机的太阳跟踪控制，以定向太阳能反射器，太阳透镜，光电板或其他光学配置朝向太阳的原理。机动空间框架和运动系统，确保运动动力学和采用的驱动技术和传动原理引导光学配置，如曼金，抛物线，圆锥曲线，或卡塞格林式太阳能集热器面向太阳，不断跟随太阳运动的轮廓。 从阳光透过太阳能跟踪器或实用的太阳能跟踪系统利用电力，可再生能源控制的自动化系统需要自动太阳跟踪软件和太阳位置算法来实现控制与自动化架构，电路板和硬件的动态运动控制。上轴太阳跟踪系统，如高度，方位角双轴或多轴太阳跟踪系统使用太阳跟踪算法或光线追踪传感器或软件，以确保通过天空中太阳的通道被跟踪的高精度的自动太阳跟踪器的应用，通过正确的夏至，春分太阳和冬至。一种高精度太阳位置计算器或太阳位置算法是这样的自动太阳能跟踪系统的设计和施工中的重要一步。 В этой книге подробно Автоматическая Solar-Tracking, ВС-Tracking-Systems, Solar-трекеры и ВС Tracker Systems.

Seja porque linguagens tradicionais como Java, C++ e C# ganham mais características funcionais a cada versão, seja porque muitas novas linguagens que têm surgido (Swift da Apple, Rust da Mozilla, Hack do Facebook) mostram uma forte influência da programação funcional, o fato é que a programação funcional, antes considerada restrita à academia, se torna cada vez mais parte do dia a dia dos desenvolvedores de todos os tipos e plataformas. Além dos benefícios abstratos de aprender um novo paradigma de programação, aprender programação funcional também serve como preparação para se atualizar nas linguagens mais tradicionais e para aprender as novas linguagens que estão aparecendo. Entre as linguagens funcionais, OCaml é uma ótima opção para começar no paradigma. Programas escritos em OCaml são compilados para código rápido (próximo do desempenho de C e C++), mas a linguagem é expressiva e de alto nível, similar a linguagens como Python e Ruby. O sistema de tipos da linguagem OCaml é muitas vezes citado como um bom exemplo de tipagem estática; é poderoso, permitindo expressar ideias e restrições complexas com tipos, mas, ao mesmo tempo, não obriga o programador a declarar os tipos das variáveis. OCaml também inclui tipos de dados algébricos e pattern matching, duas características que, quem se acostuma a usar, passa a achar indispensáveis em qualquer linguagem. Ele também possibilita o uso de características imperativas, facilitando a transição para quem não tem experiência prévia com programação funcional, reduzindo o tempo necessário para se tornar produtivo na linguagem. Este livro tem como objetivo ensinar os fundamentos da programação funcional, e, ao mesmo tempo, tornar o leitor competente na linguagem OCaml, capacitando-o a ler a maior parte do código open source disponível na linguagem e a criar seus próprios projetos com ela.","publisher":"Editora Casa do Código","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IGiCCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":278,"written_language":"pt","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IGiCCwAAQBAJ&dq=swift,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IGiCCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=swift,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=225&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780470462140","title":"eBay Business All-in-One For Dummies","author":"Marsha Collier","publish_date":"2009-02-18","description":null,"publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GYx2T4y2KPMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":864,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":3.5,"ratings_count":5,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GYx2T4y2KPMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=swift,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=226&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781878289216","title":"Global Information Systems and Technology: Focus on the Organization and Its Functional Areas","author":"P.

Starting with a clear technical definition of this term and its relation to topics like A2A (Application-to-Application), ASP (Application Service Provider), A2A, and B2C (Business-to-Consumer), Christoph Bussler outlines a complete and consistent B2B integration architecture based on a coherent conceptual model. He shows that B2B integration not only requires the exchange of business events between distributed trading partners across networks like the Internet, but also demands back-end application integration within business processes, and thus goes far beyond traditional approaches to enterprise application integration approaches. His detailed presentation describes how B2B integration standards like RosettaNet or SWIFT, the application integration standard J2EE Connector Architecture and basic standards like XML act together in order to enable business process integration. The book is the first of its kind that discusses B2B concepts and architectures independent of specific and short-term industrial or academic approaches and thus provides solid and long-lasting knowledge for researchers, students, and professionals interested in the field of B2B integration.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r-qpCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":418,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r-qpCAAAQBAJ&dq=swift,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r-qpCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=swift,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=230&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780672332692","title":"MySQL Database Design and Tuning","author":"Robert D Schneider","publish_date":"2005-06-13","description":"The authoritative, hands-on guide to advanced MySQL programming and administration techniques for high performance is here.

If you’ve ever been frustrated over the seemingly simple tasks of provisioning test databases for development projects, or spinning off reporting databases in response to fast-changing business opportunities, then you’re going to find much to like in this book. New techniques for data virtualization are built around recognizing that most of what sits in a given database remains static. To clone a database, one need only clone the small amount of data that is changing, and then to keep track of the ever-changing delta between clone and source. Virtualization helps you respond with swiftness and agility to the flood of ever-changing business requests that currently leave you harried and haggard. Creating a snapshot for reporting becomes a five-minute task involving a few button-clicks. Does every developer want their own copy of production in their development sandbox? You can give them that, and with almost no expenditure for additional storage. Migrating data into the cloud and back again can be done transparently. Data Virtualization is your introduction to the new world of software making all these things possible by transforming data management into an agile and responsive business asset. Explains the foundation for the virtualizing of corporate data Compares and contrasts different cloning technologies Presents case-studies highlighting the benefits to be obtained What you’ll learn Accelerate application development by providing each application developer with their own production sandbox, and at almost no additional cost for additional storage. Provide continuously fresh data to development and test projects at a cost less than you currently incur to provide stale and infrequently-refreshed data. Support enterprise testing efforts with high-quality data fresh from production that can be refreshed upon a moment’s notice to support iterative regression testing. Enable enterprise business intelligence by providing stable snapshots of data with unprecedented swiftness and agility. Transparently move data into and out of cloud environments, without incurring application downtime. Secure virtualized corporate data from insider threat, and outside attack. Who this book is for Virtualizing Data in Databases is aimed at those frustrated by the tangled difficulty involved in making production data available in swift and agile manner for enterprise reporting, for software development, for testing. The book also appeals to those wanting to decouple their data from specific storage platforms and gain new abilities to move data into the cloud. Virtualizing Data in Databases is written for the technology-minded business user and the management-minded technologist.","publisher":"Apress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NhkhmwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":225,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NhkhmwEACAAJ&dq=swift,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=235&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9783642131998","title":"Moving Objects Management: Models, Techniques and Applications","author":"Xiaofeng Meng, Jidong Chen","publish_date":"2011-01-27","description":"We live in an age of rapid technological development. The Internet already affects our lives in many ways. Indeed, we continue to depend more, and more intrinsically, on the Internet, which is increasingly becoming a fundamental piece of societal infrastructure, just as water supply, electricity grids, and transportation networks have been for a long time. But while these other infrastructures are relatively static, the Internet is undergoing swift and fundamental change: Notably, the Internet is going mobile. The world has some 6.7 billion humans, 4 billion mobile phones, and 1.7 billion Internet users. The two most populous continents, Asia and Africa, have relatively low Internet penetration and hold the greatest potentials for growth. Their mobile phone users by far outnumber their Internet users, and the numbers are growing rapidly. China and India are each gaining about half a dozen million new phone users per month. Users across the globe as a whole increasingly embrace mobile Internet devices, with smart phone sales are starting to outnumber PC sales. Indeed, these and other facts suggest that the Internet stands to gain a substantial mobile component. This mega trend towards “mobile” is enabled by rapid and continuing advances in key technology areas such as mobile communication, consumer electronics, g- positioning, and computing. In short, this is the backdrop for this very timely book on moving objects by Xiaofeng Meng and Jidong Chen.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XgkDCJp-zVcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":300,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XgkDCJp-zVcC&dq=swift,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XgkDCJp-zVcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=swift,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=236&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781588802989","title":"Flash 6 F/X and Design","author":"Tracy Kelly","publish_date":"2001-12-05","description":"Flash X f/x & Design teaches the intermediate to advanced functions of Flash, including 3D, sound and streaming video.
