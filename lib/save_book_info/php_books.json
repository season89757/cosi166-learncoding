It is not just the primary separation of database, business logic and interface components, but includes a wide range of considerations for building high-performing, scalable and secure applications. Deciding which MVC framework best suits the project you are about to begin is one of the biggest challenges you'll face as a developer. If you are part of a team, this decision has probably already been made for you; but in any event, you'll need to know how (and why) the framework authors made it work the way it does. Pro PHP MVC looks at the building blocks that make any good MVC framework, and how they apply to PHP. It exposes all considerations that many developers take for granted when using a popular framework, and teaches you how to make the framework your own. Over the course of reading this book, you will learn the theoretical implications of the choices you would make when writing your own MVC framework, and how to put the pieces together in a cohesive package. We take a look at the highly modular Zend Framework—how to use its collection of loosely coupled classes to build a unified system. We also look at CakePHP, learning from its automated build system (Bakery) and highly intuitive approach to rapid development. This book will lay bare all the secret parts of MVC for you. What you’ll learn The best way to structure your application files How to get from a URL to the right controller/action Cleanly interact with data objects Efficient use of server resources in content delivery Useful shared class libraries to speed up development Unit testing to ensure maximum stability Who this book is for This book is for beginners and advanced developers alike, requiring a basic understanding of PHP5 language features and SQL. If you want to improve your PHP skills, or share the wisdom of popular PHP MVC frameworks, this book will be invaluable to you.","publisher":"Apress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lMs0bObg8bIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":500,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lMs0bObg8bIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=php,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781430260325","title":"PHP Objects, Patterns, and Practice","author":"Matt Zandstra","publish_date":"2014-01-21","description":"PHP Objects Patterns and Practice, Fourth Edition is revised and updated throughout.

These provide the fundamentals of the PHP's support for objects. It also introduces some principles of design. This edition introduces new object relevant features such as traits, reflection extension additions, callable type hinting, improvements to exception handling, and many smaller language enhancements. The next section is devoted to design patterns. These describe common problems and their solutions. The section describes the design principles that make patterns powerful. It covers many of the classic design patterns and includes chapters on enterprise and database patterns. The last segment of the book covers the tools and practices that can help turn great code into a successful project. The section shows how to manage multiple developers and releases with git, how to build and install using Phing and PEAR. It also explores strategies for automated testing and build. In addition to discussing the latest developments in build, test, and continuous integration, this section keeps pace with best practice in version control by focusing on Git, increasingly the developer's system of choice. Taken together these three elements: object fundamentals, design principles, and best practice will help the reader develop elegant and rock solid systems.

Williams, David Lane","publish_date":"2004-05-13","description":"There are many reasons for serving up dynamic content from a web site: to offer an online shopping site, create customized information pages for users, or just manage a large volume of content through a database. Anyone with a modest knowledge of HTML and web site management can learn to create dynamic content through the PHP programming language and the MySQL database. This book gives you the background and tools to do the job safely and reliably.Web Database Applications with PHP and MySQL, Second Edition thoroughly reflects the needs of real-world applications. It goes into detail on such practical issues as validating input (do you know what a proper credit card number looks like?), logging in users, and using templatesto give your dynamic web pages a standard look.But this book goes even further. It shows how JavaScript and PHP can be used in tandem to make a user's experience faster and more pleasant. It shows the correct way to handle errors in user input so that a site looks professional. It introduces the vast collection of powerful tools available in the PEAR repository and shows how to use some of the most popular tools.Even while it serves as an introduction to new programmers, the book does not omit critical tasks that web sites require. For instance, every site that allows updates must handle the possibility of multiple users accessing data at the same time. This book explains how to solve the problem in detail with locking.Through a sophisticated sample application--Hugh and Dave's Wine Store--all the important techniques of dynamic content are introduced. Good design is emphasized, such as dividing logic from presentation. The book introduces PHP 5 and MySQL 4.1 features, while providing techniques that can be used on older versions of the software that are still in widespread use.This new edition has been redesigned around the rich offerings of PEAR. Several of these, including the Template package and the database-independent query API, are fully integrated into examples and thoroughly described in the text. Topics include: Installation and configuration of Apache, MySQL, and PHP on Unix®, Windows®, and Mac OS® X systems Introductions to PHP, SQL, and MySQL administration Session management, including the use of a custom database for improved efficiency User input validation, security, and authentication The PEAR repository, plus details on the use of PEAR DB and Template classes Production of PDF reports","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WuxxvP7RZasC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":820,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WuxxvP7RZasC&dq=php,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":3.0,"ratings_count":11,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WuxxvP7RZasC&printsec=frontcover&dq=php,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=29&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780596551650","title":"Learning PHP & MySQL: Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Database-Driven Web Sites","author":"Michele E.

The rapid maturation of PHP has created a skeptical population of users from more traditional \"enterprise\" languages who question the readiness and ability of PHP to scale, as well as a large population of PHP developers without formal computer science backgrounds who have learned through the hands-on experimentation while developing small and midsize applications in PHP. While there are many books on learning PHP and developing small applications with it, there is a serious lack of information on \"scaling\" PHP for large-scale, business-critical systems.

This new edition has been updated by David to incorporate changes to PHP since the second edition and to offer the latest techniques—a classic guide modernized for 21st century PHP techniques, innovations, and best practices. You want to make your websites more dynamic by adding a feedback form, creating a private area where members can upload images that are automatically resized, or perhaps storing all your content in a database. The problem is, you're not a programmer and the thought of writing code sends a chill up your spine. Or maybe you've dabbled a bit in PHP and MySQL, but you can't get past baby steps. If this describes you, then you've just found the right book. PHP and the MySQL database are deservedly the most popular combination for creating dynamic websites. They're free, easy to use, and provided by many web hosting companies in their standard packages. Unfortunately, most PHP books either expect you to be an expert already or force you to go through endless exercises of little practical value. In contrast, this book gives you real value right away through a series of practical examples that you can incorporate directly into your sites, optimizing performance and adding functionality such as file uploading, email feedback forms, image galleries, content management systems, and much more. Each solution is created with not only functionality in mind, but also visual design. But this book doesn't just provide a collection of ready-made scripts: each PHP Solution builds on what's gone before, teaching you the basics of PHP and database design quickly and painlessly. By the end of the book, you'll have the confidence to start writing your own scripts or—if you prefer to leave that task to others—to adapt existing scripts to your own requirements. Right from the start, you're shown how easy it is to protect your sites by adopting secure coding practices.","publisher":"Apress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IYgnCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":512,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IYgnCgAAQBAJ&dq=php,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":4.5,"ratings_count":5,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IYgnCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=php,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=35&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780672323256","title":"PHP Developer's Cookbook","author":"Sterling Hughes, Andrei Zmievski","publish_date":"2001","description":"PHP is an open source server side scripting language for creating dynamic web pages for ecommerce and other web applications offering a simple and universal solution for easy-to-program dynamic web pages.

Not surprisingly, this surge in usage has resulted in a number of PHP books hitting the market. Only one, though, takes the language beyond traditional Web programming and into mapping, graphing, multimedia, and beyond: PHP Hacks. In PHP Hacks, author Jack Herrington wrings out his 20 years of code generation experience to deliver hands-on tools ranging from basic PHP and PEAR installation and scripting to advanced multimedia and database optimizing tricks. On the practical side of things, PHP Hacks helps you develop more robust PHP applications by explaining how to improve your database design, automate application testing, and employ design patterns in your PHP scripts and classes. In the category of \"cool,\" Herrington explains how to upgrade your Web interface through the creation of tabs, stickies, popups, and calendars. He even examines how to leverage maps and graphics in PHP. There's also a bounty of image and application hacks, including those that show you how to: Integrate web sites with Google maps and satellite imaging Dynamically display iPhoto libraries online Add IRC, SMS, and Instant Messaging capabilities to your Web applications Drop the latest Wikipedia dictionary onto your Sony PSP Render graphics and user interfaces with SVG, DHTML, and Ajax Whether you're a newcomer or an expert, you'll find great value in PHP Hacks, the only PHP guide that offers something useful and fun for everyone.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kJV1tmal5_AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":468,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kJV1tmal5_AC&dq=php,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":3.5,"ratings_count":6,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kJV1tmal5_AC&printsec=frontcover&dq=php,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=37&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780735712270","title":"XML and PHP","author":"Vikram Vaswani","publish_date":"2002","description":"This is a clear, concise guide to the synergies between XML and PHP, many of which are not immediately visible to intermediate developers.

Brooks","publish_date":"2009-03-01","description":"The best way to become acquainted with a subject is to write a book about it. —Benjamin Disraeli i. Background The purpose of this book is provide an introduction to using a server-side programming language to solve some kinds of computing problems that cannot be solved with a client-side language such as JavaScript. The language is PHP (originally created in 1994 by Danish/Icelandic programmer Rasmus Lerdorf as “Personal Home Page Tools” for dealing with his own web site). The PHP language does not have a formal specification, as C does, for example. It is developed and maintained by a User Group of volunteers and is, essentially, defined by the most recently available free download. Although this might seem to be a shaky foundation on which to make a commitment to learning a programming language, PHP has a very large world-wide base of users and applications, which ensures its role into the foreseeable future. This book should not be considered as a PHP reference source and it does not deal exhaustively even with those elements of the PHP language used in the book. (This should be considered a blessing by the casual programmer. ) If you need more information, there is a huge amount of information online about PHP. Hopefully, this book will help you filter this information to focus on solving typical science and engineering problems. An excellent online source for information about PHP is http://www. php. net/manual/en/index. php, maintained by the PHP 1 Documentation Group.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WVTBxbvw5zQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":141,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WVTBxbvw5zQC&dq=php,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WVTBxbvw5zQC&pg=PA75&dq=php,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=96&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780131471498","title":"PHP 5 Power Programming","author":"Andi Gutmans, Stig Sæther Bakken, Derick Rethans","publish_date":"2005","description":"Written by the authors of the actual PHP code!

Why? Because they know many of these apps are written by programmers with little or no experience or training in software security. Don’t be victimized. Securing PHP Web Applications will help you master the specific techniques, skills, and best practices you need to write rock-solid PHP code and harden the PHP software you’re already using. Drawing on more than fifteen years of experience in Web development, security, and training, Tricia and William Ballad show how security flaws can find their way into PHP code, and they identify the most common security mistakes made by PHP developers. The authors present practical, specific solutions—techniques that are surprisingly easy to understand and use, no matter what level of PHP programming expertise you have. Securing PHP Web Applications covers the most important aspects of PHP code security, from error handling and buffer overflows to input validation and filesystem access. The authors explode the myths that discourage PHP programmers from attempting to secure their code and teach you how to instinctively write more secure code without compromising your software’s performance or your own productivity. Coverage includes Designing secure applications from the very beginning—and plugging holes in applications you can’t rewrite from scratch Defending against session hijacking, fixation, and poisoning attacks that PHP can’t resist on its own Securing the servers your PHP code runs on, including specific guidance for Apache, MySQL, IIS/SQL Server, and more Enforcing strict authentication and making the most of encryption Preventing dangerous cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks Systematically testing yourapplications for security, including detailed discussions of exploit testing and PHP test automation Addressing known vulnerabilities in the third-party applications you’re already running Tricia and William Ballad demystify PHP security by presenting realistic scenarios and code examples, practical checklists, detailed visuals, and more.

The purpose of this book is to give you the best possible foundation for understanding how each of the core components work separately and together, which will enable you to take full advantage of all that they have to offer. When you’ve finished reading this book, you’ll have a thorough understanding of the core concepts you need to be an effective developer using Apache, MySQL, and PHP, and hopefully a burning desire to continue learning and growing as a developer. We assume that anyone reading this book has some experience with web site development concepts and a basic working knowledge of HTML and CSS. Knowledge of other programming languages besides PHP is not a prerequisite for this book, but certainly any programming experience you have will help you understand and apply the concepts we present. This book is geared toward the “newbie” to Apache, MySQL, and PHP, and we’ve done our best to distill many of the core concepts and code snippets down to their most basic levels. You will find more complex and perhaps more efficient ways of accomplishing the same tasks we present in this book as your knowledge, comfort level, and experience increase. When that happens, you can congratulate yourself and know that you have come over to the “dark side” to join us as Apache, MySQL, and PHP enthusiasts! A variety of topics are covered in this book: Installation and configuration of Apache, MySQL, and PHP Basic introduction to each component and how they interact with one another Gathering information from and interacting with your web site visitors How to avoid errors and how to handle them when they inevitably occur Creating, altering and working with image files Handling user registration and logins E-mailing and setting up e-mail lists Building a content management system Enhancing your web site by adding e-commerce capabilities Incorporating a discussion forum into your site Monitoring the health of your web site through the use of activity logs and error logs Selecting a third-party web hosting provider Finding the text editor that’s right for you Using multiple interfaces to connect to MySQL from PHP As you read through the chapters in this book and learn about each of these topics, you will be creating two complete web sites. The first is a movie review site that displays information about films and their respective reviews. This project will cover the basics, such as writing PHP code, creating a MySQL database, filling the database with data and showing specific information to your visitors based on what they want to see. The second project is a comic book fan web site. This site will be developed in the latter part of the book and will incorporate some of the more complex topics of working with Apache, MySQL and PHP. You will create a truly interactive web site where your visitors can interact with you and with other members of the site. We take you step by step through the development of each of these sites, and you will continually build upon them as new concepts are introduced. Note, however, that each of the chapters in this book has been designed as a standalone chapter, so that if you are not particularly interested in reading a specific topic then you are free to move on to another. If you thought the days of the “pop quiz” were over, think again! We have provided handy exercises at the end of most of the chapters to test your knowledge of discussed topic and challenge you to think one step further. We’ve provided answers to these exercises in Appendix A. This book is designed to be multiplatform and we cover topics and issues for both Windows-based and Linux-based machines. You will need Apache, MySQL and PHP to do the exercises in this book. All three are open source programs, so you can download and use them free of charge. We have provided instructions for downloading and installing all three components in Chapter 1 and Appendix I. You will also need a text editor to enter your code. Many editors are available that you can use, and some of the more popular ones are compared in Appendix F. Finally, you’ll need a web browser, such as Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Apple Safari or Opera to view your web pages.","publisher":"Wrox","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8CPSZACKJ_AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":816,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":1.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8CPSZACKJ_AC&dq=php,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=191&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780764537998","title":"MySQL / PHP Database Applications","author":"Brad Bulger, Jay Greenspan, David Wall","publish_date":"2003-11-10","description":null,"publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_8tMXRbsi5oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":808,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_8tMXRbsi5oC&dq=php,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_8tMXRbsi5oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=php,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=192&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780782140217","title":"XML Processing with Perl, Python, and PHP","author":"Martin C.

Have you looked into creating your own web site before but found the amount of information on the Internet too daunting or not geared for your skill set or worse-- just plain boring? Are you interested in learning to program PHP and have some fun along the way? If so, then The Joy of PHP by Alan Forbes is the book for you!! Alan starts with some basic HTML so the absolute beginner can catch up quickly and then goes step by step on how PHP works. You start with the easy stuff--like how to create and run simple PHP scripts that modify web pages-- and then build on what you've learned through a series of cohesive (and fun) exercises that carry over from lesson to lesson. As the chapters progress you begin to build a web site for a growing used car dealership business. This approach keeps the material fun and challenging-- and gives what you've learned a context to be relevant. A car dealership needs a constantly changing web site because the inventory of cars is always changing. HTML is not the answer for this kind of web site-- but PHP and mySQL are! Throughout the book you will be working with the web site for the car dealership and adding features and modifying it as the needs of the business (and your knowledge) grow. This writing style reinforces the previous lessons and keeps you engaged in a \"real\" project -- giving you both a sense of accomplishment and an opportunity to apply what you've learned to a realistic scenario. You are far more likely to retain what you've learned using this approach than just reading dry syntax documentation. The author has an easy and fun style of writing that teaches you PHP in a simple, matter of fact manner while showing you the most common uses of the commands you need to get the job done. This keeps your learning pace quick and uncluttered. If you need it, he also points you to several resources where you can learn more about the other options a PHP function can offer and-- even better--how to read and understand those resources. If you want to learn the PHP language in an easy, enjoyable, well laid out manner and to learn why PHP and mySQL are so powerful and fun to use then buy this book!! Do not buy this book if you are looking for a comprehensive reference of boring PHP syntax. This book does not attempt to cover everything about PHP. What it does do-- and does well-- is take you from being a beginner who isn't even sure what PHP is to someone who knows the sheer joy that only programming dynamic sites can provide. You will become someone who can read, write, and modify PHP scripts and you will be able make your website come alive. All the source code referenced in the book is available for easy download and also well organized. You don't have to cut and paste out of Kindle or retype code, unless you want to.

It is a general-purpose, data-driven, content-based site that can be easily modified to meet the needs of many real sites you'll develop as a professional site developer. After introducing the overall approach and architecture for the n-tier design of the site, each chapter of the book discusses the business rationale behind the site features being developed in the chapter. After this business problem is explained, the chapter describes the technical features needed to solve the problem, including some background that will be useful to experienced PHP developers. From there, the chapter produces and discusses the code of the solution. The chapters and individual site features are not designed to be developed independently, but rather as part of a whole, just as a complete site would normally be developed in a real setting. The book doesn't hide difficult problems to make the solution simpler, rather it tackles them head on so that the solution is robust enough to really use. Some of the features in the site include: Membership and user profiles Content management system for news, article management, photos Opinion polls newsletters ecommerce with support for real-time credit card processing Forums Downloads Photo gallery Personalization Localization Advertising","publisher":"Wrox PressInc","image_url":null,"total_pages":504,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PCQMkgEACAAJ&dq=php,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=265&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781155200422","title":"Free Software Programmed in Php: Drupal, Mediawiki, Phpbb, Wordpress, Jumper 2. 0, Cakephp, Phpwebsite, Tcpdf, Exponent Cms, Spip, B2evolution","author":"Books, LLC","publish_date":"2010-05","description":"Please note that the content of this book primarily consists of articles available from Wikipedia or other free sources online.

Excerpt: MediaWiki is a popular free web-based wiki software application. Developed by the Wikimedia Foundation, it is used to run all of its projects, including Wikipedia, Wiktionary and Wikinews. Numerous other wikis around the world also use it to power their websites. It is written in the PHP programming language and uses a backend database. The first version of the software was deployed to serve the needs of the free content Wikipedia encyclopedia in 2002. It has been deployed since then by many companies as a content management system for internal knowledge management. Notably, Novell uses it to operate several of its high-traffic websites. Thousands of websites use MediaWiki. Some educators have also assigned students to use MediaWiki for collaborative group projects. The software is optimized to correctly and efficiently handle projects of all sizes, including the largest wikis, which can have terabytes of content and hundreds of thousands of hits per second.

A esto se añaden valores como el hecho de ser un proyecto de código abierto, gratuito y multiplataforma, por lo que desde la aparición de la nueva versión, PHP 5, no ha hecho sino incrementar aún más su número de usuarios. Introducción a PHP 5 le permitirá, independientemente de su nivel inicial, dominar todos los aspectos relacionados con la generación de un sitio web dinámico. El lector encontrará la más completa documentación acerca del modo en que PHP interactúa con su navegador y servidor web, para centrarse posteriormente en los fundamentos del funcionamiento del lenguaje y las innumerables posibilidades que permite. Con un enfoque claro y preciso, este manual recoge las tareas esenciales en la creación de un sitio interactivo, como tratar con formularios, conseguir que sus programas PHP se comuniquen con una base de datos o lograr que su sitio realice operaciones específicas para un usuario. Una vez que esté familiarizado con la dinámica de este intérprete, podrá progresar hacia aspectos más avanzados como la detección y depuración de errores, la generación de imágenes, ejecutar código escrito en otros lenguajes o crear películas Flash.","publisher":"Anaya Multimedia-Anaya Interactiva","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NZqMAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":415,"written_language":"es","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":2,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NZqMAAAACAAJ&dq=php,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=270&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9788441525146","title":"Ajax, JavaScript y PHP","author":"Phil Ballard, Michael Moncur","publish_date":"2009-01-02","description":"Los sitios Web ya no están limitados por una serie de páginas estáticas, ahora las herramientas y tecnologías Web nos permiten desarrollar páginas atractivas con animaciones, efectos visuales, contenido sensible al contexto, herramientas de productividad incorporadas y mucho más.

La salida al mercado de Flash CS3 Professional ha propiciado una actualización de este libro. Aquí se combina Flash con un lenguaje de servidor realmente versátil como PHP y la base de datos MySQL para producir proyectos. Si bien el concepto sobre el que gira el tratamiento dinámico de datos mediante Flash, PHP y MySQL sigue siendo el mismo, el soporte sobre el que se trabaja es ahora más rápido, estable y eficiente.
