Although primarily a tool for developers, PL/SQL has also become an essential tool for database administration, as DBAs take increasing responsibility for site performance and as the lines between developers and DBAs blur. Until now, there has not been a book focused squarely on the language topics of special concern to DBAs Oracle PL/SQL for DBAs fills the gap. Covering the latest Oracle version, Oracle Database 10g Release 2 and packed with code and usage examples, it contains: A quick tour of the PL/SQL language, providing enough basic information about language fundamentals to get DBAs up and running Extensive coverage of security topics for DBAs: Encryption (including both traditional methods and Oracle's new Transparent Data Encryption, TDE); Row-Level Security(RLS), Fine-Grained Auditing (FGA); and random value generation Methods for DBAs to improve query and database performance with cursors and table functions Coverage of Oracle scheduling, which allows jobs such as database monitoring andstatistics gathering to be scheduled for regular execution Using Oracle's built-in packages (DBMS_CRYPTO, DBMS_RLS, DBMS_FGA, DBMS_RANDOM,DBMS_SCHEDULING) as a base, the book describes ways of building on top of these packages to suit particular organizational needs. Authors are Arup Nanda, Oracle Magazine 2003 DBA of the Year, and Steven Feuerstein, the world's foremost PL/SQL expert and coauthor of the classic reference, Oracle PL/SQL Programming.

Covering the latest Oracle release, Oracle Database 11gR2, Feuerstein has rewritten this new edition in the style of his bestselling Oracle PL/SQL Programming. The text is organized in a problem/solution format, and chronicles the programming exploits of developers at a mythical company called My Flimsy Excuse, Inc., as they write code, make mistakes, and learn from those mistakes-and each other. This book offers practical answers to some of the hardest questions faced by PL/SQL developers, including: What is the best way to write the SQL logic in my application code? How should I write my packages so they can be leveraged by my entire team of developers? How can I make sure that all my team's programs handle and record errors consistently? Oracle PL/SQL Best Practices summarizes PL/SQL best practices in nine major categories: overall PL/SQL application development; programming standards; program testing, tracing, and debugging; variables and data structures; control logic; error handling; the use of SQL in PL/SQL; building procedures, functions, packages, and triggers; and overall program performance. This book is a concise and entertaining guide that PL/SQL developers will turn to again and again as they seek out ways to write higher quality code and more successful applications. \"This book presents ideas that make the difference between a successful project and one that never gets off the ground.

Oracle's PL/SQL language is a programming language providing procedural extensions to the SQL relational database language and to an ever-growing number of Oracle development tools. Among the most useful constructs in the PL/SQL language are the built-in functions and packages. Built-in functions are constructs that operate on certain types of data (e.g., numeric, character) to return a result. By using functions, you can minimize the coding you need to do in your programs. Functions are described in detail in Steven Feuerstein'sOracle PL/SQL Programming; this comprehensive guide to building applications with PL/SQL has become the bible for PL/SQL developers who have raved about its completeness, readability, and practicality. Built-in functions fall into several major categories: Character functions: Operate on character data. Examples include CONCAT (concatenates two strings into one), LENGTH (returns the length of a string), and REPLACE (replaces a character sequence in a string with a different set of characters). Date functions: Operate on dates and supplement the DATE datatype. Examples include SYSDATE (returns the current date and time in the Oracle Server) and LAST_DAY (returns the last day in the month of the specified date). Numeric functions: Operate on numeric data. Examples include CEIL (returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the specified number) and POWER (returns a number raised to a particular power). LOB functions: Operate on large object data. Examples include EMPTY_BLOB (returns an empty locator of the binary large object type) and EMPTY_CLOB (returns an empty locator of the character large object type). Conversion functions: Perform explicit conversions of different types of data. Examples include TO_CHAR (converts a number or date to a string) and TO_NUMBER (converts a string to a number). Miscellaneous functions. Examples include GREATEST (returns the greatest of the specified list of values) and UID (returns the user ID of the current Oracle session). Built-in packages (collections of PL/SQL objects, such as functions, procedures, and data structures) greatly expand the scope of the PL/SQL language. These packages are described in detail in Feuerstein's and Beresniewicz's book,Oracle Built-in Packages. Built-in packages are built by Oracle Corporation and stored directly in the Oracle database. The functionality of the built-ins is available from any programming environment that can call PL/SQL stored procedures, including Visual Basic, Oracle Developer/2000, Oracle Application Server (for Web-based development), and, of course, the Oracle database itself. Built-in packages extend the capabilities and power of PL/SQL in many significant ways. For example: DBMS_SQL executes dynamically constructed SQL statements and PL/SQL blocks of code. DBMS_PIPE communicates between different Oracle sessions through a pipe in the RDBMS shared memory. DBMS_JOB submits and manages regularly scheduled jobs for execution inside the database. DBMS_LOB accesses and manipulates Oracle8's large objects (LOBs) from within PL/SQL programs. The book shows how to call all of the commonly used built-in functions and packages. For packages, it also shows the RESTRICT REFERENCES pragmas (needed if you call packages from a SQL statement), as well as the exceptions, constants, and data structures defined in the packages.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SODiWg8nGFcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":72,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SODiWg8nGFcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=pl/sql,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=27&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780071710473","title":"Oracle JDeveloper 10g for Forms & PL/SQL Developers: A Guide to Web Development with Oracle ADF","author":"Peter Koletzke, Duncan Mills","publish_date":"2006-09-28","description":"The most efficient way to learn J2EE programming techniques Two Oracle experts demonstrate techniques for working within J2EE and JDeveloper for the thousands of developers currently using Oracle Forms and the PL/SQL language.

Oracle Database is chock-full of built-in application features that are free for the using, and PL/SQL is your ticket to learning about and using those features from your own code. With it, you can centralize business logic in the database, you can offload application logic, and you can automate database- and application-administration tasks. Author Don Bales provides in Beginning Oracle PL/SQL a fast-paced and example-filled tutorial. Learn from Don’s extensive experience to discover the most commonly used aspects of PL/SQL, without wasting time on obscure and obsolete features. The author takes his 20+ years of experience and a wealth of statistics he's gathered on PL/SQL usage over those years and applies the 80/20 rule: cover what's most needed and used by PL/SQL professionals and avoid what's not necessary! The result is a book that covers all the key features of PL/SQL without wasting your time discussing esoteric and obsolete parts of the language. Learn what really matters, so that you can get to work feeling confident with what you know about PL/SQL. Covers the key topics that matter, including variables and datatypes, executing statements, working with cursors, bulk operations, real-world objects, debugging, testing, and more. Teaches you to write production-level, object-oriented PL/SQL. You'll explore relational PL/SQL, but unlike most other books on the subject, this one emphasizes the use of PL/SQLs object-oriented features as well. Guides you in working through real examples of using of PL/SQL. You'll learn PL/SQL by applying it to real-world business problems, not by heavy theory.","publisher":"Apress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OV8nCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":492,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OV8nCgAAQBAJ&dq=pl/sql,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OV8nCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=pl/sql,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=41&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780072860467","title":"Oracle SQL and Introductory PL/SQL","author":"Linda L.

Data theft is becoming so common that even the BBC evening news talks about data breaches, hackers, identity theft, and much more on a seemingly regular basis with no consideration now for what was a technical subject just a short time ago. The public is aware of data theft and loss, so you as a PL/SQL developer must also be aware of the key threats and causes. Secure Coding in PL/SQL starts with the basics: why data is insecure, what makes it insecure, why the way Oracle Database works causes concern over securing of data, and what we as practitioners of Oracle Database and PL/SQL inadvertently do to make matters worse. Focus is on issues and their underlying causes, helping you to first understand why an issue even exists, and then laying out a solution. The author is an expert in the subject of PL/SQL security and data security in general, and is well-known for his expertise in design, good coding practice, and ideas and methods for security. Secure Coding in PL/SQL starts with why data can be insecure in your database, investigating poor design choices and advising best practice. The book also covers all common insecure coding techniques that allow data loss or your code to be an attack vector for hackers. The author then looks at best practice with realistic techniques and tips that can be used to ensure securely coded PL/SQL. The book also investigates why your PL/SQL itself can be the target of attack. Some attackers may simply steal your code and use it as a black box, or they may be more interested in learning the algorithms that you have used in order to exploit holes in those algorithms in an attack. We explore techniques to prevent such things. The book completes with a discussion on next steps such as creating policies, and testing and scanning of existing or new PL/SQL code. What you’ll learn Learn why data can be insecure in an Oracle database Grasp the ground rules for good code and data design Avoid insecure coding style and detect insecure code Follow ground rules and practices for writing code to withstand attack Secure your PL/SQL source code itself, from theft and from loss of intellectual property rights Implement automated testing of new and existing code to ensure compliance with policies and best practice Who this book is for Secure Coding in PL/SQL is aimed squarely at programmers responsible for writing PL/SQL that runs inside an Oracle Database Instance. The book is also helpful to database administrators tasked with ensuring the security of their databases against malicious attack and data theft.","publisher":"Apress","image_url":null,"total_pages":100,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xY3-rQEACAAJ&dq=pl/sql,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=75&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9783836608688","title":"Analysis and Visualization of Biological Publication Data","author":"Maren Lang","publish_date":"2008-01-29","description":"Inhaltsangabe:Abstract: The content of today s World Wide Web is semantically not well structured. Every-thing is built for people and the data is therefore machine-readable but not machine- understandable. The semantic Web provides a solution for this problem through a new form of content structure. One technology for developing the Semantic Web is the Resource Description Framework (RDF). RDF is a language for representing information about resources in the World Wide Web and is particularly intended for representing metadata about Web resources. Therefore RDF provides interoperability between applications that exchange machine-understandable information on the Web. In this work, existing biological publication data which is stored in an object-relational database, is transformed into data represented in RDF. With the newly created RDF model it is possible to make a new way of queries, not only key word searching, but also queries with semantic sense. The additional advantage oft his representation is that it can be described not only in triples or XML structure but also in directed graphs. The World Wide Web provides documents that are built for human usage. There are formats like HTML, SVG and other extensions like Javascript or Javaapplets which are made for representing information. The content is semantically not well structured. These documents are structured for their presentation and are meant for people rather than computer which process data and information automatically. Everything is built for people and the data therefore is machine-readable but not machine-understandable. The Semantic Web provides a solution for this problem through a new form of structuring the content of the Web. It is not a separate Web but an extension of the existing one. There is, beside the documents of the Web, well defined additional information, which the computer is able to exploit automatically. This will give search engines more selective results as answer to the user enquired queries. Current search engines normally provide a big quantity of results to which the user has not or hardly referred initially. Their criteria of assigning a document to the set of relevant documents are the occurrences of one or several keywords. The results could be more precise if additional information which concerns the question would be considered. For example if somebody searches a document of mister Miller, the search engine could take into account, that one searches an article which has an author named Miller and not to select all articles where the word Miller appears. Adding logic to the Web also means to use rules to make inferences, choose courses and ask questions, which is the task before the Semantic Web community at the moment. One technology for developing the Semantic Web is the eXtensible Markup Language (XML). XML allows users to add arbitrary structure to their documents but says nothing about what the structures means. But the Semantic Web will enable machines to comprehend semantic documents and data, not human speech and writings. Meaning is expressed by the Resource Description Framework (RDF) which provides the basic building blocks for supporting the Semantic Web.

PL/SQL is a programming language providing procedural extensions to the SQL relational database language and to an ever-growing number of oracle development tools. originally a rather limited tool, PL/SQL became with Oracle7 a mature and effective language for developers. now, with the introduction of Oracle8, PL/SQL has taken the next step towards becoming a fully realized programming language providing sophisticated object-oriented capabilities. Steven Feuerstein'sOracle PL/SQL Programming is a comprehensive guide to building applications with PL/SQL. That book has become the bible for PL/SQL developers who have raved about its completeness, readability, and practicality.Built-in packages are collections of PL/SQL objects built by Oracle Corporation and stored directly in the Oracle database. The functionality of these packages is available from any programming environment that can call PL/SQL stored procedures, including Visual Basic, Oracle Developer/2000, Oracle Application Server (for web-based development), and, of course, the Oracle database itself. Built-in packages extend the capabilities and power of PL/SQL in many significant ways. for example: DBMS_SQL executes dynamically constructed SQL statements and PL/SQL blocks of code. DBMS_PIPE communicates between different Oracle sessions through a pipe in the RDBMS shared memory. DBMS_JOB submits and manages regularly scheduled jobs for execution inside the database. DBMS_LOB accesses and manipulates Oracle8's large objects (LOBs) from within PL/SQL programs. The first edition of Oracle PL/SQL Programming contained a chapter on Oracle's built-in packages. but there is much more to say about the basic PL/SQL packages than Feuerstein could fit in his first book. In addition, now that Oracle8 has been released, there are many new Oracle8 built-in packages not described in the PL/SQL book. There are also packages extensions for specific oracle environments such as distributed database. hence this book.Oracle Built-in Packages pulls together information about how to use the calling interface (API) to Oracle's Built-in Packages, and provides extensive examples on using the built-in packages effectively.The windows diskette included with the book contains the companion guide, an online tool developed by RevealNet, Inc., that provides point-and-click access to the many files of source code and online documentation developed by the authors.The table of contents follows:PrefacePart I: Overview 1.

Written in an easygoing and example-based style, Beginning Oracle SQL is the book that will get you started down the path to successfully writing SQL statements and getting results from Oracle Database. Takes an example-based approach, with clear and authoritative explanations Introduces both SQL and the query tools used to execute SQL statements Shows how to create tables, populate them with data, and then query that data to generate business results What you’ll learn Create database tables and define their relationships. Add data to your tables. Then change and delete that data. Write database queries that generate accurate results. Avoid common traps and pitfalls in writing SQL queries, especially from nulls. Reap the performance and expressiveness of analytic and window functions. Make use of Oracle Database's support for object types. Write recursive queries to query hierarchical data.

It might be enough to pass a survey course, or give you some buzz words to drop in conversation with real Oracle DBAs. But if you use Oracle SQL on a regular basis, you want much more. You want to access the full power of SQL to write queries in an Oracle environment. You want a solid understanding of what's possible with Oracle SQL, creative techniques for writing effective and accurate queries, and the practical, hands-on information that leads to true mastery of the language. Simply put, you want useful, expert best practices that can be put to work immediately, not just non-vendor specific overview or theory.Updated to cover the latest version of Oracle, Oracle 10g, this edition of the highly regarded Mastering Oracle SQL has a stronger focus on technique and on Oracle's implementation of SQL than any other book on the market. It covers Oracle s vast library of built-in functions, the full range of Oracle SQL query-writing features, regular expression support, new aggregate and analytic functions, subqueries in the SELECT and WITH clauses, multiset union operators, enhanced support for hierarchical queries: leaf and loop detection, and the CONNECT_BY_ROOT operator, new partitioning methods (some introduced in Oracle9i Release 2), and the native XML datatype, XMLType.Mastering Oracle SQL, 2nd Edition fills the gap between the sometimes spotty vendor documentation, and other books on SQL that just don't explore the full depth of what is possible with Oracle-specific SQL. For those who want to harness the untapped (and often overlooked) power of Oracle SQL, this essential guide for putting Oracle SQL to work will prove invaluable.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r5vbGgz7TFsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":496,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r5vbGgz7TFsC&dq=pl/sql,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":4.5,"ratings_count":5,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r5vbGgz7TFsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=pl/sql,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=104&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781565925786","title":"Oracle SQL*Plus: ","author":"Jonathan Gennick","publish_date":"1999","description":"An interactive guide to Oracle's intensive query tool, SQL* Plus, discusses its powerful features, furnishes a syntax quick reference, and explains how to write and execute script files, generate reports, extract data from the database, utilize new administrative features, query data dictionary tables, and more.

Dentro de estas capacidades destaca la programación orientada a objetos.El lenguaje PL/SQL empaqueta varias órdenes SQL en un único bloque PL/SQL, que se envía al servidor como una unidad. De esta forma se disminuye el tráfico en la red y aumenta la velocidad de la aplicación. Si el cliente y el servidor están en la misma máquina, el rendimiento crece y el empaquetar las órdenes SQL en bloques PL/SQL sigue produciendo un programa más simple que realiza menos llamadas a la base de datos y que es rentable aunque no exista red.Entre PL/SQL y la base de datos se transmite la información mediante variables, que no son más que zonas de almacenamiento que pueden ser leídas y escritas por el programa. Los bloques suelen tener una sección llamada sección declarativa en la que por regla general se declaran las variables. Cada variable tiene asociado un tipo que define la clase de información que se puede almacenar en ella. Los tipos de las variables pueden ser similares a los de las columnas de una base de datos, aunque PL/SQL también admite como tipos definidos por el usuario a las tablas y a las columnas. También es posible utilizar tipos de objetos que tienen métodos y atributos, que pueden ser almacenados en una base de datos, y que elevan al lenguaje PL/SQL a la categoría de lenguaje de programación orientado al objeto.El contenido esencial del libro es el siguiente:Modelo orientado a objetoBase de datos objeto-relacional ORACLE Conceptos de la orientación a objetos El modelo de datos orientado a objetos UML El modelo estándar ODMG Sistemas objeto relacionales El lenguaje objeto-relacional PL/SQL La estructura de PL/SQL Los bloques en PL/SQL Unidades léxicas Tipos de estructuras de control en PL/SQL Bucles Registros en PL/SQL Tablas y matrices Varrays SQL en PL/SQL Cursores Subprogramas almacenadosProcedimientos Funciones Paquetes Disparadores Excepciones PL/SQL dinámicoCursores con SQL dinámico Objetos y colecciones Introducción a la programación orientada a objetos Bases de datos objeto-relacionales Tipos de objetos Objetos de base de datos Objetos transitorios y persistentes Identificadores y referencias a objetos Objetos en las órdenes DML VarraysTablas anidadas Varrays en la base de datos Colecciones Pl/sql y java Ejecución de programas java con PL/SQL Oracle como modelo distribuido Sistema gestor de bases de datos distribuidoEtapas en el acceso a datos distribuidos Tablas distribuidas Tablas reflejadas","publisher":"CreateSpace","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uCNVnwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":170,"written_language":"es","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uCNVnwEACAAJ&dq=pl/sql,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=106&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780130850331","title":"Programming Oracle Triggers and Stored Procedures","author":"Kevin Owens","publish_date":"2004","description":"Complete tutorial for database developers!Thorough coverage of PL/SQLPractical \"cookbook\" techniques Effectively create and manage complex databases with Oracle!

El libro comienza en un nivel muy básico con la idea de introducir al lector paso a paso en la programación de Oracle. Se comenzará mostrando la introducción de código en el entorno SQL*Plus y el desarrollo amplio del modelo entidad-relación a través de Oracle SQL que constituye el pilar básico de la programación en las bases de datos relacionales. Así mismo, se trata de forma exhaustiva el lenguaje de programación procedimental PL/SQL de Oracle, que amplía el lenguaje estándar SQL. PL/SQL (Procedural Lenguaje/SQL) es un lenguaje de programación que se utiliza para acceder y trabajar con bases de datos Oracle desde distintos entornos. PL/SQL amplía la funcionalidad del lenguaje SQL añadiendo estructuras típicas de los lenguajes procedimentales, como las variables y los tipos, las estructuras de control (bucles, órdenes IF-THEN-ELSE, etc.), los procedimientos y las funciones, los tipos de objetos y los métodos, y otras estructuras clásicas en los lenguajes de programación procedimentales. Resulta así un lenguaje robusto y potente que combina la flexibilidad de SQL con la potencia y configurabilidad de las construcciones procedimentales.En el trabajo con aplicaciones de bases de datos es típica la estructura cliente-servidor formada por un servidor de bases de datos que recibe peticiones de información de programas residentes en máquinas clientes conectadas por la red con el servidor. Las solicitudes de información suelen llevarse a cabo en lenguaje SQL, lo que da lugar a múltiples comunicaciones por la red (una por cada petición SQL). Para racionalizar este tráfico de información se utiliza PL/SQL, que empaqueta varias órdenes SQL en un único bloque PL/SQL, que se envía al servidor como una unidad. De esta forma se disminuye el tráfico en la red y aumenta la velocidad de la aplicación. Si el cliente y el servidor están en la misma máquina, el rendimiento crece y el empaquetar las órdenes SQL en bloques PL/SQL sigue produciendo un programa más simple que realiza menos llamadas a la base de datos y que es rentable aunque no exista red. Por lo tanto la unidad básica en PL/SQL es el bloque, estando formados los programas por combinaciones de bloques que incluso pueden estar anidados. De esta forma se separan las tareas unas de otras porque cada bloque realiza una unidad lógica de trabajo en el programa.Entre PL/SQL y la base de datos se transmite la información mediante variables, que no son más que zonas de almacenamiento que pueden ser leídas y escritas por el programa. Los bloques suelen tener una sección llamada sección declarativa en la que por regla general se declaran las variables. Cada variable tiene asociado un tipo que define la clase de información que se puede almacenar en ella. Los tipos de las variables pueden ser similares a los de las columnas de una base de datos, aunque PL/SQL también admite como tipos definidos por el usuario a las tablas y a las columnas. También es posible utilizar tipos de objetos que tienen métodos y atributos, que pueden ser almacenados en una base de datos, y que elevan al lenguaje PL/SQL a la categoría de lenguaje de programación orientado al objeto.","publisher":"CreateSpace","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sLhSngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":362,"written_language":"es","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sLhSngEACAAJ&dq=pl/sql,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=115&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780738438757","title":"Oracle to DB2 Conversion Guide: Compatibility Made Easy","author":"Yvonne Chan, Nick Ivanov, Olaf Mueller, IBM Redbooks","publish_date":"2014-07-03","description":"This IBM® Redbooks® publication describes IBM DB2® SQL compatibility features. The latest version of DB2 includes extensive native support for the PL/SQL procedural language, new data types, scalar functions, improved concurrency, built-in packages, OCI, SQLPlus, and more. These features can help with developing applications that run on both DB2 and Oracle and can help simplify the process of moving from Oracle to DB2. In addition, IBM now provides tools to simplify the enablement process, such as the highly scalable IBM Data Movement Tool for moving schema and data into DB2, and an Editor and Profiler for PL/SQL provided by the IBM Data Studio tool suite. This Oracle to DB2 migration guide describes new technology, preferred practices for moving to DB2, and common scenarios that can help you as you move from Oracle to DB2. This book is intended for IT architects and developers who are converting from Oracle to DB2. DB2 compatibility with Oracle is provided through native support. The new capabilities in DB2 that provide compatibility are implemented at the lowest and most intimate levels of the database kernel, as though they were originally engineered for DB2. means that the DB2 implementation is done without the aid of an emulation layer. This intimacy leads to the scalable implementation that DB2 offers, providing identical performance between DB2 compatibility features and DB2 other language elements. For example, DB2 runs SQL PL at the same performance as PL/SQL implementations of the same function.","publisher":"IBM Redbooks","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_VfAAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":456,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_VfAAgAAQBAJ&dq=pl/sql,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_VfAAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=pl/sql,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=116&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781494491635","title":"Programacin orientada a objetos con Oracle PL/SQL / Object-Oriented Programming with Oracle PL / SQL","author":"Maria Perez Marques","publish_date":"2013-12","description":"La base de datos Oracle presenta capacidades de programación de alto nivel que permiten el uso versátil de la información y facilitan el trabajo con los datos desde los entornos sencillos, pasando por los entornos cliente-servidor hasta llegar a los entornos distribuidos.

Learning these concepts and techniques prepares students for the first exam in both the Oracle Database Administrator and Oracle Developer Certification Exam paths and offers a solid understanding of using Oracle 11g SQL effectively. The first part of ORACLE 11G: SQL focuses on creating database objects, including tables, constraints, indexes, sequences, synonyms, and users, and manipulating data. The second part explores data query techniques, such as row filtering, joins, single-row functions, aggregate functions, subqueries, and views. Several advanced query topics, such as ROLLUP, CUBE, and TOP-N analysis, are also introduced. To help students bridge these SQL topics to further studies, appendixes introduce SQL tuning, compare Oracle’s SQL syntax with other databases (MS SQL Server and MySQL), and explain how to embed SQL in applications (ASP.NET). An overview of the two Oracle connection interface tools, SQL Developer and SQL Plus, is also provided.

The main objective of this book is to expose the students and professionals to the latest technology, relevant theory and software development tools. This book serves as a guide to design and develop the cloud computing-based software projects using distributed architecture. It consolidates the theory, upcoming technologies and development tools for the development of two software projects—Outstation Claim Management System (OCMS) and Retirement Benefit Calculation System (RBCS). Both the projects start with the feasibility study to understand and appreciate the problem. After understanding the problem and identifying the suitable software, hardware and network environment, the problem is formally depicted using the entity relationship model and data flow diagrams. This is followed by normali-zation, creation of tables and procedures. In the book, Oracle, PL/SQL, Internet Developer Suite (IDS) and .Net framework are used to develop the full-fledged GUI-based applications. The book elaborates the problem, providing logic and interface screens to design and develop the projects using any other programming language and GUI tool in which the students are comfortable with. The book also includes a CD-ROM, which contains the source codes of OCMS and RBCS. The book is meant for the undergraduate and postgraduate students of Computer Science, Computer Applications and Information Technology. Besides, it would also be useful to the professionals to enhance their technical skills. After going through this book, the students/professionals will be able to: Work on real-life projects.Implement the SDLC in software projects.Design the data flow diagrams and entity relationship diagrams.Use the database and normalization in software projects.Do the corrective, adaptive and perfective maintenance of a software.Learn the concepts related to IaaS, PaaS and SaaS of Cloud Computing.","publisher":"PHI Learning Pvt.

By now, most companies have hardened their perimeters and locked out the \"bad guys,\" but what has been done on the inside? This book attacks the problem of the soft, chewy center in internal networks. We use a two-pronged approach-Tactical and Strategic-to give readers a complete guide to internal penetration testing. Content includes the newest vulnerabilities and exploits, assessment methodologies, host review guides, secure baselines and case studies to bring it all together. We have scoured the Internet and assembled some of the best to function as Technical Specialists and Strategic Specialists. This creates a diversified project removing restrictive corporate boundaries. The unique style of this book will allow it to cover an incredibly broad range of topics in unparalleled detail. Chapters within the book will be written using the same concepts behind software development. Chapters will be treated like functions within programming code, allowing the authors to call on each other's data. These functions will supplement the methodology when specific technologies are examined thus reducing the common redundancies found in other security books. This book is designed to be the \"one-stop shop\" for security engineers who want all their information in one place. The technical nature of this may be too much for middle management; however technical managers can use the book to help them understand the challenges faced by the engineers who support their businesses. Ø Unprecedented Team of Security Luminaries. Led by Foundstone Principal Consultant, Erik Pace Birkholz, each of the contributing authors on this book is a recognized superstar in their respective fields. All are highly visible speakers and consultants and their frequent presentations at major industry events such as the Black Hat Briefings and the 29th Annual Computer Security Institute Show in November, 2002 will provide this book with a high-profile launch. Ø The only all-encompassing book on internal network security. Windows 2000, Windows XP, Solaris, Linux and Cisco IOS and their applications are usually running simultaneously in some form on most enterprise networks. Other books deal with these components individually, but no other book provides a comprehensive solution like Special Ops.

The design of both databases and applications is an often neglected area of Oracle, but one that has an enormous impact on the ultimate power and performance of a system. If the initial design is poor, then the most powerful hardware, the most sophisticated software tools, and the most highly tuned data and programs won't make your system run smoothly and efficiently. Indeed, applications that have been designed poorly will never be able to perform well, regardless of the tuning and retrofitting performed later on. There are three main areas of Oracle design: The design of the specific database objects (e.g., tables, views, indexes, stored functions) that will be implemented in a database. The design of the screens, reports, and programs that will maintain the data and allow inquiries against it. Under certain circumstances, the design must also be concerned with the specific environment or technology (e.g., the network topology, the hardware configuration, and the use of a client/server, parallel processing, or distributed database architecture). This book examines all aspects of database and code design. Part I examines the project life cycle and where design fits in that cycle; it shows a sample case study, identifies the areas of Oracle7 that are of particular interest to designers, takes a look ahead at Oracle8, and provides an in-depth discussion of data modeling (e.g., entities, relationships, attributes, entity models, function hierarchies). Part II describes design issues for the database itself -- denormalization, data types, keys, indexes, temporal data, import/export, backup, recovery, security, and more. Part III explores design issues for specific architectures and environments -- client/server, distributed database, data warehouses, and parallel processing. Part IV describes design issues for the code that accesses the database -- metrics and prototypes, locking, the toolset, design of screens, reports, batch programs, etc. Part V contains summary appendixes. The table of contents follows: Part I: Getting Started with Design 1. Introduction 2. Why is Design so Important for Oracle? 3. Data Modeling Part II: Designing the Database 4.

A data model contains tables and relationships between tables. Tuning a data model involves normalization and de-normalization. Different approaches are required depending on the application, such as OLTP or a Data Warehouse. Inappropriate database design can make SQL code impossible to tune. Poor data modeling can have a most profound effect on database performance since all SQL code is constructed from the data model. Poorly written SQL code is often a culprit of performance problems and is expensive to rectify. However, tuning of SQL code is generally cheaper than changing the data model. SQL code tends to be contained inside independent blocks within applications or stored procedures. Physical database tuning involves hardware resource usage, networking and various other Oracle things such as configuration and file distribution. Physical configuration is often a culprit of poor performance where Oracle is installed with defaults, and never altered by an expert. *Includes all three aspects of Oracle database tuning: data model tuning, SQL & PL/SQL code tuning, physical plus configuration tuning *Contains experienced guidance and real-world examples using large datasets *Emphasizes development as opposed to operating system perspective","publisher":"Digital Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MFgDkAv1bT8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":544,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MFgDkAv1bT8C&dq=pl/sql,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":5,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MFgDkAv1bT8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=pl/sql,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=196&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780072134896","title":"Troubleshooting SQL","author":"Forrest Houlette","publish_date":"2001","description":"This programmer's resource explains how to optimize SQL statements and procedures and create a customized SQL debugging environment for error-free applications.

Oracle is arguably the most widely used relational database platform in the world. In this book, Donald Bales brings these two technologies together, and shows you how to leverage the full power of Oracle's implementation of JDBC. You begin by learning the all-important mysteries of establishing database connections. This can be one of the most frustrating areas for programmers new to JDBC, and Donald covers it well with detailed information and examples showing how to make database connections from applications, applets, Servlets, and even from Java programs running within the database itself. Next comes thorough coverage of JDBC's relational SQL features. You'll learn how to issue SQL statements and get results back from the database, how to read and write data from large, streaming data types such as BLOBs, CLOBs, and BFILEs, and you'll learn how to interface with Oracle's other built-in programming language, PL/SQL. If you're taking advantage of the Oracle's relatively new ability to create object tables and column objects based on user-defined datatypes, you'll be pleased with Don's thorough treatment of this subject. Don shows you how to use JPublisher and JDBC to work seamlessly with Oracle database objects from within Java programs. You'll also learn how to access nested tables and arrays using JDBC. Donald concludes the book with a discussion of transaction management, locking, concurrency, and performance--topics that every professional JDBC programmer must be familiar with.

It provides a comprehensive approach to learning the Java programming language for intermediate and advanced level Java programmers. If you are new to the Java programming language, you are suggested to read the first and second volumes of this title before this volume. This volume covers the advanced topics of Java programming language such as Swing, Network Programming, and JDBC. Each topic in the book starts with a discussion of the topic's background. A step-by-step process, with small snippets of Java code, provides easy to follow instructions. At the end of a topic, a complete and ready-to-run Java program is provided. This volume contains over 130 images and diagrams to help programmers visualize and better understand the topics. More than 130 complete programs, included in this volume, allow the readers to practice and quickly learn the topics. The chapter on Swing uses a unique approach to building an application with a graphical user interface (GUI). It discusses various aspects, from the very basic concepts of developing a Swing application, to the most advanced topics, such as decorating a Swing component with a JLayer, Drag-and-Drop features, Synth Skinnable L&F, etc. The chapter starts with an introduction to the GUI, using only one line of Java code, and builds to the most advanced concepts of GUI, one-step at a time. The chapter devotes over 55 pages to describe, at length, the different kinds of layout managers. At each step, it includes images to help the reader visualize how the application will look at runtime. Images at every step of the GUI building help the readers finish the chapter more quickly, with a vivid, detailed understanding of each topic. The chapter on network programming covers the basics of network technologies first, and then, the advanced topics of network programming, using Java class library. It covers IPv4 and IPv6, addressing schemes, subnetting, supernetting, multicasting, TCP/IP sockets, UPD sockets, asynchronous socket I/O, etc. The chapter on JDBC provides one of a kind coverage of database programming using the JDBC API.

In the first stage, they learn the language itself. In the second stage, they study the APIs. In the third stage, they become proficient in the environment. It is in the fourth stage --\"the expert stage\"-- where things really get interesting, and Java Enterprise Best Practices is the tangible compendium of experience that developers need to breeze through this fourth and final stage of Enterprise Java mastery.Crammed with tips and tricks, Java Enterprise Best Practices distills years of solid experience from eleven experts in the J2EE environment into a practical, to-the-point guide to J2EE.Java Enterprise Best Practices gives developers the unvarnished, expert-tested advice that the man pages don't provide--what areas of the APIs should be used frequently (and which are better avoided); elegant solutions to problems you face that other developers have already discovered; what things you should always do, what things you should consider doing, and what things you should never do--even if the documentation says it's ok.Until Java Enterprise Best Practices, Java developers in the fourth stage of mastery relied on the advice of a loose-knit community of fellow developers, time-consuming online searches for examples or suggestions for the immediate problem they faced, and tedious trial-and-error. But Java has grown to include a huge number of APIs, classes, and methods. Now it is simply too large for even the most intrepid developer to know it all. The need for a written compendium of J2EE Best Practices has never been greater.Java Enterprise Best Practices focuses on the Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) APIs. The J2EE APIs include such alphabet soup acronyms as EJB, JDBC, RMI, XML, and JMX.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YFB8vndosmUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":292,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YFB8vndosmUC&dq=pl/sql,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YFB8vndosmUC&pg=PT88&dq=pl/sql,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=228&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780071799317","title":"Oracle Database 12c New Features","author":"Robert Freeman","publish_date":"2013-12-10","description":"Maximize the New and Improved Features of Oracle Database 12c Written by Master Principle Database Expert, Oracle, and Oracle ACE Robert G.

Esta guía representa una vía rápida para aprender a trabajar con SQL, conociendo gran parte de las sentencias de este lenguaje y aprendiendo a usarlas en ejemplos prácticos utilizando Microsoft Access, Oracle, SQL Server y MySQL. Tras una introducción al modelo de datos relacional, el más usado en la actualidad, se explica cómo ejecutar consultas sencillas, cómo aplicar filtros y realizar búsquedas, cómo ordenar los datos, efectuar uniones entre consultas o agrupar la información por categorías. Se aborda además el estudio de todas las sentencias relacionadas con la manipulación de los datos, así como las que permiten definir las estructuras de las bases de datos. Finalmente, se describe el proceso de creación de elementos más complejos como los desencadenadores, funciones y procedimientos almacenados, usando para ello los lenguajes derivados de SQL: Transact-SQL, PL/SQL y SQL/PSM. Aprenderá a completar cualquier operación sobre una base de datos, conociendo la sintaxis estándar de SQL y en muchos casos los aspectos específicos de cada producto.","publisher":null,"image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TZJ5QgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":352,"written_language":"es","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TZJ5QgAACAAJ&dq=pl/sql,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=283&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780071502306","title":"Oracle Database 10g OCP Certification All-In-One Exam Guide","author":"Damir Bersinic, John Watson","publish_date":"2005-10-03","description":"The Most Authoritative OCA/OCP Exam Guide Available Prepare to pass the OCA and OCP Oracle Database 10g certification exams with help from this Oracle Press guide.
