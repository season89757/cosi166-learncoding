This is followed by an in-depth section on assembly language which explains each instruction in the 8052 instruction set as well as related concepts such as assembly language syntax, expressions, assembly language directives, and how to implement 16-bit mathematical functions. The book continues with a thorough explanation of the 8052 hardware itself, reviewing the function of each pin on the microcontroller and follows this with the design and explanation of a fully functional single board computer-every section of the schematic design is explained in detail to provide the reader with a full understanding of how everything is connected, and why. The book closes with a section on hardware interfacing and software examples in which the reader will learn about the SBCMON monitor program for use on the single board computer, interfacing with a 4x4 keypad, communicating with a 16x2 LCD in direct-connect as well as memory-mapped fashion, utilizing an external serial EEPROM via the SPI protocol, and using the I2C communication standard to access an external real time clock.

Gilder","publish_date":"2012-12-06","description":"The Apple / / series of computers represents one of the most versatile and powerful home computers available. If you've used your computer for a while, you've probably become quite familiar with Applesoft BASIC. That's good, because once you know that, this book will show you how to graduate from BASIC programming to assembly language programming. There are many reasons to program your Apple in assembly language. First and foremost is speed. Assembly language is about 100 times faster than BASIC. If you're thinking of writing games or business programs that do sorting, speed is of the essence and assembly language is a must. Assembly language programs usually also require less memory. Thus you can squeeze more complex programs into a smaller amount of memory. Finally, assembly language programs offer you a considerable amount of security, because they are more difficult to trace and change. While assembly language is powerful, it doesn't have to be difficult to learn. In fact, if you can write programs in Applesoft BASIC, you're already half-way home. This book assumes you know BASIC and absolutely nothing about assembly language or machine language. Every effort has been made to write in nontechnical language and to set the chapters out in a logical manner, introducing new concepts in digestible pieces as and when they are needed, rather than devoting whole chapters to specific items.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=e8olBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":178,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e8olBAAAQBAJ&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e8olBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=63&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"VAX Assembly Language","author":"Sara Baase","publish_date":"1992","description":"A practical introduction to the VAX assembly language.","publisher":null,"image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SpVYAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":507,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SpVYAAAAYAAJ&q=assembly+language,+subject:computers&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=64&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"Assembly language routines for the IBM PC","author":"Joe Dorner","publish_date":"1985-09","description":null,"publisher":"Brady","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y6wmAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":185,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y6wmAAAAMAAJ&q=assembly+language,+subject:computers&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=65&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"CP/M-86 Assembly Language Programming","author":"Jon Lindsay","publish_date":"1986-01","description":"Details Assembly Language under the CP-M 86 Operating System for the Inexperienced User","publisher":"Brady","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OJxEAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":332,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OJxEAAAAIAAJ&q=assembly+language,+subject:computers&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=66&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781483268590","title":"Computer Organization and Assembly Language Programming","author":"James L.

The book explains the operations of the computer at the machine language level. The text reviews basic computer operations, organization, and deals primarily with the MIX computer system. The book describes assembly language programming techniques, such as defining appropriate data structures, determining the information for input or output, and the flow of control within the program. The text explains basic I/O programming concepts, technique of interrupts, and an overlapped I/O. The text also describes the use of subroutines to reduce the number of codes that are repetitively written for the program. An assembler can translate a program from assembly language into a loader code for loading into the computer's memory for execution. A loader can be of several types such as absolute, relocatable, or a variation of the other two types. A linkage editor links various small segments into one large segment with an output format similar to an input format for easier program handling. The book also describes the use of other programming languages which can offer to the programmer the power of an assembly language by his using the syntax of a higher-level language. The book is intended as a textbook for a second course in computer programming, following the recommendations of the ACM Curriculum 68 for Course B2 \"Computers and Programming.","publisher":"Academic Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PaijBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":464,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PaijBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA132&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=67&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780134780412","title":"Introduction to Assembly Language for the TI Home Computer","author":"Ralph Molesworth","publish_date":"1983","description":"Covers binary and hexadecimal arithmetic, addressing, registers, and coding, tells how to write a program in assembly language, and discusses screen displays, file handling, arrays, and sorts","publisher":"Prentice Hall Direct","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zzoSAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":139,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zzoSAQAAMAAJ&q=assembly+language,+subject:computers&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=68&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"Assembly language programming for the IBM Personal Computer","author":"David J.

Assembly is the fundamental language bridging human ideas and the pure silicon hearts of computers, and popular author Jeff Dunteman retains his distinctive lighthearted style as he presents a step-by-step approach to this difficult technical discipline. He starts at the very beginning, explaining the basic ideas of programmable computing, the binary and hexadecimal number systems, the Intel x86 computer architecture, and the process of software development under Linux. From that foundation he systematically treats the x86 instruction set, memory addressing, procedures, macros, and interface to the C-language code libraries upon which Linux itself is built. Serves as an ideal introduction to x86 computing concepts, as demonstrated by the only language directly understood by the CPU itself Uses an approachable, conversational style that assumes no prior experience in programming of any kind Presents x86 architecture and assembly concepts through a cumulative tutorial approach that is ideal for self-paced instruction Focuses entirely on free, open-source software, including Ubuntu Linux, the NASM assembler, the Kate editor, and the Gdb/Insight debugger Includes an x86 instruction set reference for the most common machine instructions, specifically tailored for use by programming beginners Woven into the presentation are plenty of assembly code examples, plus practical tips on software design, coding, testing, and debugging, all using free, open-source software that may be downloaded without charge from the Internet.","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=veMTOpapeZkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":648,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=veMTOpapeZkC&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":4,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=veMTOpapeZkC&pg=PT30&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=71&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"IBM PC assembly language and programming","author":"Peter Abel","publish_date":"1991","description":null,"publisher":null,"image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I8RQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":540,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":2.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I8RQAAAAMAAJ&q=assembly+language,+subject:computers&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=72&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"8080/8085: Assembly Language Su Proutines","author":"Lance A.

Designed for students in computer science and engineering who have taken one high-level language programming course, it uses a top-down approach, introducing an abstract (registerless) assembly language first. This approach enables students to build on previous knowledge and allows them to write programs from the beginning of the course. Topics covered include basic computer organization, data representation, data structures, the assembly process, exception handling, and more.

The primary addition to the second edition is the discussion of the free integrated development environment, ebe, designed by the author specifically to meet the needs of assembly language programmers. Ebe is a Python program which uses the Tkinter and Pwm widget sets to implement a GUI environment consisting of a source window, a data window, a registers window, a console window, a terminal window and a project window. The source window includes a full-featured text editor with convenient controls for assembling, linking and debugging a program. The project facility allows a program to be built from C source code files and assembly source files. Assembly is performed automatically using the yasm assembler and linking is performed with ld or gcc. Debugging operates by transparently sending commands into the gdb debugger while automatically displaying registers and variables after each debugging step. Additional information about ebe can be found at http: //www.rayseyfarth.com. The book is intended as a first assembly language book for programmers experienced in high level programming in a language like C or C++. The assembly programming is performed using the yasm assembler automatically from the ebe IDE under the Linux operating system. The book primarily teaches how to write assembly code compatible with C programs. The reader will learn to call C functions from assembly language and to call assembly functions from C in addition to writing complete programs in assembly language. The gcc compiler is used internally to compile C programs. The book starts early emphasizing using ebe to debug programs, along with teaching equivalent commands using gdb. Being able to single-step assembly programs is critical in learning assembly programming. Ebe makes this far easier than using gdb directly. Highlights of the book include doing input/output programming using the Linux system calls and the C library, implementing data structures in assembly language and high performance assembly language programming. Early chapters of the book rely on using the debugger to observe program behavior. After a chapter on functions, the user is prepared to use printf and scanf from the C library to perform I/O. The chapter on data structures covers singly linked lists, doubly linked circular lists, hash tables and binary trees. Test programs are presented for all these data structures. There is a chapter on optimization techniques and 3 chapters on specific optimizations. One chapter covers how to efficiently count the 1 bits in an array with the most efficient version using the recently-introduced popcnt instruction. Another chapter covers using SSE instructions to create an efficient implementation of the Sobel filtering algorithm. The final high performance programming chapter discusses computing correlation between data in 2 arrays. There is an AVX implementation which achieves 20.5 GFLOPs on a single core of a Core i7 CPU. A companion web site, http: //www.rayseyfarth.com, has a collection of PDF slides which instructors can use for in-class presentations and source code for sample programs.","publisher":"CreateSpace","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JS8GMAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":310,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JS8GMAEACAAJ&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=126&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780471478331","title":"Fundamentals of Computer Organization and Architecture","author":"Mostafa Abd-El-Barr, Hesham El-Rewini","publish_date":"2005-02-22","description":null,"publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m6uFlL41TlIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":288,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m6uFlL41TlIC&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":3.5,"ratings_count":5,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m6uFlL41TlIC&pg=PA37&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=127&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780982692622","title":"Embedded Systems with Arm Cortex-M3 Microcontrollers in Assembly Language and C","author":"Yifeng Zhu","publish_date":"2014-08-01","description":"This book introduces basic programming of ARM Cortex chips in assembly language and the fundamentals of embedded system design.

In my view, the content is unique in that it blends traditional teaching approaches with the use of mathematics and a mainstream Hardware Design Language (HDL) as formalisms to describe key concepts. The book keeps the ‚Äúmachine‚Äù separate from the ‚Äúapplication‚Äù by strictly following a bottom-up approach: it starts with transistors and logic gates and only introduces assembly language programs once their execution by a processor is clearly de ned. Using a HDL, Verilog in this case, rather than static circuit diagrams is a big deviation from traditional books on computer architecture. Static circuit diagrams cannot be explored in a hands-on way like the corresponding Verilog model can. In order to understand why I consider this shift so important, one must consider how computer architecture, a subject that has been studied for more than 50 years, has evolved. In the pioneering days computers were constructed by hand. An entire computer could (just about) be described by drawing a circuit diagram. Initially, such d- grams consisted mostly of analogue components before later moving toward d- ital logic gates. The advent of digital electronics led to more complex cells, such as half-adders, ip- ops, and decoders being recognised as useful building blocks.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X1m1tNcfWQYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":642,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=X1m1tNcfWQYC&pg=PA418&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=130&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"Assembly language programming for the 68000","author":"Arthur Gill, Edward Corwin, Antonette Logar","publish_date":"1987","description":null,"publisher":"Prentice Hall","image_url":null,"total_pages":248,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xUYnAAAAMAAJ&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=131&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780452254978","title":"Assembly Language Primer for the IBM PC","author":"Robert W.

This book is intended as a follow-on to a previously published book, titled Atmel AVR Microcontroller Primer: Programming and Interfacing. Some of the content from this earlier text is retained for completeness. This book will emphasize advanced programming and interfacing skills. We focus on system level design consisting of several interacting microcontroller subsystems. The first chapter discusses the system design process. Our approach is to provide the skills to quickly get up to speed to operate the internationally popular Atmel AVR microcontroller line by developing systems level design skills. We use the Atmel ATmega164 as a representative sample of the AVR line. The knowledge you gain on this microcontroller can be easily translated to every other microcontroller in the AVR line. In succeeding chapters, we cover the main subsystems aboard the microcontroller, providing a short theory section followed by a description of the related microcontroller subsystem with accompanying software for the subsystem. We then provide advanced examples exercising some of the features discussed. In all examples, we use the C programming language. The code provided can be readily adapted to the wide variety of compilers available for the Atmel AVR microcontroller line. We also include a chapter describing how to interface the microcontroller to a wide variety of input and output devices. The book concludes with several detailed system level design examples employing the Atmel AVR microcontroller.

In this guide, I list a handful of starter languages that I consider are essential in various science and technology fields that require programming skills. This guide is not a tutorial on learning to programme, but an overview of what languages to start learning. Note that a starter language is not necessarily easy to learn. And it may not even be one of the more popular languages used in the industry. But mastering it will give you the fundamental knowledge necessary to acquire additional programming skills. I begin this guide with a bit of background by drawing analogies between human languages and computer languages. Next, I provide a short list of programming languages, which I consider are essential in various fields of science. Then, I conclude with a few tips on how best to cope with the ever-changing field of software development. Along the way, I weave fragments of computing history and bits of career advice into the discussions. My intended audience is those who are contemplating a career in science, are starting to learn how to programme, and are motivated to learn on their own. 2015-06-10: ¬∑ Reformat for better flow for Amazon Kindle (.mobi) and Google Play (.epub) ¬∑ Update contents to reflect the recent changes in the industry ¬∑ Add a section listing reference books on theory and practice ¬∑ Add author contact information 2014-06-06: ¬∑ Initial publication","publisher":"sOnit, Inc.","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-GXAAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":76,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-GXAAwAAQBAJ&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-GXAAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA17&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=183&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781461431435","title":"Introduction to Embedded Systems: Using Microcontrollers and the MSP430","author":"Manuel Jim√©nez, Rogelio Palomera, Isidoro Couvertier","publish_date":"2013-09-11","description":"This textbook serves as an introduction to the subject of embedded systems design, using microcontrollers as core components.

Instead of promoting the one language that will solve all design problems (which does not and will not ever exist), this book takes the view that different problems demand different languages, and a designer who knows the spectrum of available languages has the advantage over one who is trapped using the wrong language. Languages for Digital Embedded Systems concentrates on successful, widely-used design languages, with a secondary emphasis on those with significant theoretical value. The syntax, semantics, and implementation of each language is discussed, since although hardware synthesis and software compilation technology have steadily improved, coding style still matters, and a thorough understanding of how a language is synthesized or compiled is generally necessary to take full advantage of a language. Practicing designers, graduate students, and advanced undergraduates will all benefit from this book. It assumes familiarity with some hardware or software languages, but takes a practical, descriptive view that avoids formalism.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2wEkV4VbsksC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":306,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2wEkV4VbsksC&pg=PA11&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=187&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781852339425","title":"The Quintessential PIC¬Æ Microcontroller","author":"Sid Katzen","publish_date":"2007-07-05","description":"Written specifically for readers with no prior knowledge of computing, electronics, or logic design.

Topics covered range from assembly language and microprocessor design to the Motorola 6800, programming techniques, control of peripheral devices, and high-level languages. Emphasis is given to the computer-like aspects of microprocessors. This text is comprised of 12 chapters; the first of which provides a general overview of microprocessors, differences between hardwired and programmed devices, and different kinds of microprocessors. The reader is then introduced to the basic types of information inside a microprocessor, including Boolean information, numerical information, character codes, and the machine code. The chapters that follow focus on the intellectual and practical tools that the designer of a microprocessor system will need. The basic structure of a microprocessor is analyzed, with particular reference to a simple hypothetical computer and some programs for this machine. This book also discusses assembly language; some of the features that give microprocessors their flexibility as well as generality and power; and the Motorola 6800 microprocessor as an example of machine architecture. Some programming techniques, high-level languages for writing programs, and the problem of bringing the hardware and software together are highlighted. This book will be useful to computer programmers, computer scientists, and electronic engineers.","publisher":"Newnes","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QWmeBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":216,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QWmeBQAAQBAJ&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QWmeBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA30&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=191&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780898382020","title":"Efficient Parsing for Natural Language: A Fast Algorithm for Practical Systems","author":"Masaru Tomita","publish_date":"1985-09-30","description":"Parsing Efficiency is crucial when building practical natural language systems. 'Ibis is especially the case for interactive systems such as natural language database access, interfaces to expert systems and interactive machine translation.

In the areas of compiler design and theoretical computer science, on the other hand, parsing algorithms 3 have been evaluated primarily in terms of the theoretical worst case analysis (e.g. lXn¬ª, and very few practical comparisons have been made. This book introduces a context-free parsing algorithm that parses natural language more efficiently than any other existing parsing algorithms in practice.

The primary addition to the third edition is the discussion of the new version of the free integrated development environment, ebe, designed by the author specifically to meet the needs of assembly language programmers. The new ebe is a C++ program using the Qt library to implement a GUI environment consisting of a source window, a data window, a register, a floating point register window, a backtrace window, a console window, a terminal window and a project window along with 2 educational tools called the \"toy box\" and the \"bit bucket.\" The source window includes a full-featured text editor with convenient controls for assembling, linking and debugging a program. The project facility allows a program to be built from C source code files and assembly source files. Assembly is performed automatically using the yasm assembler and linking is performed with ld or gcc. Debugging operates by transparently sending commands into the gdb debugger while automatically displaying registers and variables after each debugging step. Additional information about ebe can be found at http: //www.rayseyfarth.com. The second important addition is support for the OS X operating system. Assembly language is similar enough between the two systems to cover in a single book. The book discusses the differences between the systems. The book is intended as a first assembly language book for programmers experienced in high level programming in a language like C or C++. The assembly programming is performed using the yasm assembler automatically from the ebe IDE under the Linux operating system. The book primarily teaches how to write assembly code compatible with C programs. The reader will learn to call C functions from assembly language and to call assembly functions from C in addition to writing complete programs in assembly language. The gcc compiler is used internally to compile C programs. The book starts early emphasizing using ebe to debug programs, along with teaching equivalent commands using gdb. Being able to single-step assembly programs is critical in learning assembly programming. Ebe makes this far easier than using gdb directly. Highlights of the book include doing input/output programming using the Linux system calls and the C library, implementing data structures in assembly language and high performance assembly language programming. Early chapters of the book rely on using the debugger to observe program behavior. After a chapter on functions, the user is prepared to use printf and scanf from the C library to perform I/O. The chapter on data structures covers singly linked lists, doubly linked circular lists, hash tables and binary trees. Test programs are presented for all these data structures. There is a chapter on optimization techniques and 3 chapters on specific optimizations. One chapter covers how to efficiently count the 1 bits in an array with the most efficient version using the recently-introduced popcnt instruction. Another chapter covers using SSE instructions to create an efficient implementation of the Sobel filtering algorithm. The final high performance programming chapter discusses computing correlation between data in 2 arrays. There is an AVX implementation which achieves 20.5 GFLOPs on a single core of a Core i7 CPU. A companion web site, http: //www.rayseyfarth.com, has a collection of PDF slides which instructors can use for in-class presentations and source code for sample programs.","publisher":"Createspace Independent Pub","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jve2oAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":270,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jve2oAEACAAJ&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=223&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780080513881","title":"PIC BASIC: Programming and Projects","author":"Dogan Ibrahim","publish_date":"2001-08-29","description":"PIC BASIC is the simplest and quickest way to get up and running - designing and building circuits using a microcontroller.

The sophistication of attacks against computer systems increases with each new Internet worm.What's the worst an attacker can do to you? You'd better find out, right? That's what Security Warrior teaches you. Based on the principle that the only way to defend yourself is to understand your attacker in depth, Security Warrior reveals how your systems can be attacked. Covering everything from reverse engineering to SQL attacks, and including topics like social engineering, antiforensics, and common attacks against UNIX and Windows systems, this book teaches you to know your enemy and how to be prepared to do battle.Security Warrior places particular emphasis on reverse engineering. RE is a fundamental skill for the administrator, who must be aware of all kinds of malware that can be installed on his machines -- trojaned binaries, \"spyware\" that looks innocuous but that sends private data back to its creator, and more. This is the only book to discuss reverse engineering for Linux or Windows CE. It's also the only book that shows you how SQL injection works, enabling you to inspect your database and web applications for vulnerability.Security Warrior is the most comprehensive and up-to-date book covering the art of computer war: attacks against computer systems and their defenses. It's often scary, and never comforting. If you're on the front lines, defending your site against attackers, you need this book.

Written in a remarkably clear style, Creating a Software Engineering Culture presents a comprehensive approach to improving the quality and effectiveness of the software development process. In twenty chapters spread over six parts, Wiegers promotes the tactical changes required to support process improvement and high-quality software development. Throughout the text, Wiegers identifies scores of culture builders and culture killers, and he offers a wealth of references to resources for the software engineer, including seminars, conferences, publications, videos, and on-line information. With case studies on process improvement and software metrics programs and an entire part on action planning (called ‚ÄúWhat to Do on Monday‚Äù), this practical book guides the reader in applying the concepts to real life. Topics include software culture concepts, team behaviors, the five dimensions of a software project, recognizing achievements, optimizing customer involvement, the project champion model, tools for sharing the vision, requirements traceability matrices, the capability maturity model, action planning, testing, inspections, metrics-based project estimation, the cost of quality, and much more! Principles from Part 1 Never let your boss or your customer talk you into doing a bad job. People need to feel the work they do is appreciated. Ongoing education is every team member‚Äôs responsibility. Customer involvement is the most critical factor in software quality. Your greatest challenge is sharing the vision of the final product with the customer. Continual improvement of your software development process is both possible and essential. Written software development procedures can help build a shared culture of best practices. Quality is the top priority; long-term productivity is a natural consequence of high quality. Strive to have a peer, rather than a customer, find a defect. A key to software quality is to iterate many times on all development steps except coding: Do this once. Managing bug reports and change requests is essential to controlling quality and maintenance. If you measure what you do, you can learn to do it better. You can‚Äôt change everything at once. Identify those changes that will yield the greatest benefits, and begin to implement them next Monday. Do what makes sense; don‚Äôt resort to dogma.","publisher":"Addison-Wesley","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uVsUAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":384,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uVsUAAAAQBAJ&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uVsUAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA170&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=233&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9783642548338","title":"Programming Languages and Systems: 23rd European Symposium on Programming, ESOP 2014, Held as Part of the European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software, ETAPS 2014, Grenoble, France, April 5-13, 2014, Proceedings","author":"Zhong Shao","publish_date":"2014-03-21","description":"This book constitutes the proceedings of the 23rd European Symposium on Programming, ESOP 2014, which took place in Grenoble, France, in April 2014, as part of the European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software, ETAPS 2014.

Suitable for self-study or as part of a two-course introduction to programming, the book covers as much material as possible from the latest Java standard while requiring no previous programming experience. Taking an application-motivated approach, the text presents an abundance of games. Students must read through the whole chapter to understand all the features that are needed to implement the game. Most chapters start with a description of a game and then introduce different Java constructs for implementing the features of the game on need-to-use bases. The text teaches students not only how to write code that works but also how to follow good software practices. All sample programs in the text strive to achieve low cohesion and high coupling‚Äîthe hallmarks of well-designed code. Many programs are refactored multiple times to achieve code that is easy to understand, reuse, and maintain. The first part of the book covers basic programming techniques, such as conditional statements, loops, methods, arrays, and classes.

It is designed to take practicing professionals ‚Äúunder the hood of a PC and provide them with an understanding of the basics of the complex machine that has become such a pervasive part of our everyday life. It clearly explains how hardware and software cooperatively interact to accomplish real-world tasks. Instead of simply demonstrating how to design a computer‚Äôs hardware, it provides an understanding of the total machine, highlighting strengths and weaknesses, explaining how to deal with memory and how to write efficient assemble code that interacts with and takes best advantage of the underlying hardware. Additionally, the book has a unique emphasis on facilitating the ability to make real engineering decisions in industry when working with anything from simple 8-bit microprocessors in embedded applications to PCs and workstations. It demystifies the link between the behaviour of the code and the operation of the machine, while helping engineers and students to better understand the limitations imposed by finite speed and resources.

Want to learn more? Whether you‚Äôre a self-taught iPhone development genius or have just made your way through the pages of Beginning iPhone 3 Development, we have the perfect book for you. More iPhone 3 Development: Tackling iPhone SDK 3 digs deeper into Apple‚Äôs latest SDK. Best-selling authors Dave Mark and Jeff LaMarche explain concepts as only they can, covering topics like Core Data, peer-to-peer networking using GameKit and network streams, working with data from the web, MapKit, in-application e-mail, and more. All the concepts and APIs are clearly presented with code snippets you can customize and use, as you like, in your own apps. If you are going to write a professional iPhone app, you‚Äôll want to get your arms around Core Data, and there‚Äôs no better place to do so than in the pages of this book. The book continues right where Beginning iPhone 3 Development left off with a series of chapters devoted to Core Data, the standard for persistence that Apple introduced to iPhone with SDK 3. Jeff and Dave carefully step through each of the Core Data concepts and show you techniques and tips specifically for writing larger applications‚Äîoffering a breadth of coverage you won't find anywhere else. The Core Data coverage alone is worth the price of admission. But there's so much more. This book covers a variety of networking mechanisms, from GameKit‚Äôs relatively simple BlueTooth peer-to-peer model, to the addition of Bonjour discovery and network streams, through the complexity of accessing files via the web. Dave and Jeff will also take you through coverage of concurrent programming and some advanced techniques for debugging your applications. Whether you are a relative newcomer to iPhone development or an old hand looking to expand your horizons, there‚Äôs something for everyone in More iPhone 3 Development. Note: A few of the apps in this book demonstrate technologies not yet supported by the simulator. To run them on your iPhone or iPod touch, you'll need to join one of Apple's paid iPhone developer programs.","publisher":"Apress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F5jrMwxw8mAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":552,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F5jrMwxw8mAC&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F5jrMwxw8mAC&pg=PA501&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=252&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"Assembly lines, the book: a beginner's guide to 6502 programming on the Apple II","author":"Roger Wagner","publish_date":"1982","description":null,"publisher":null,"image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=saEfAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":273,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=saEfAQAAIAAJ&q=assembly+language,+subject:computers&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=253&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780131002876","title":"Thinking in Java","author":"Bruce Eckel","publish_date":"2003","description":"An overview of the programming language's fundamentals covers syntax, initialization, implementation, classes, error handling, objects, applets, multiple threads, projects, and network programming.","publisher":"Prentice Hall Professional","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ql6QgWf6i7cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":1119,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":81,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ql6QgWf6i7cC&pg=PA32&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=254&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780763771447","title":"Computer Systems","author":"J.

Anyone who is interested in ports, transducer interfacing, analog to digital conversion, convolution, filters or digital/analog conversion will benefit from reading Interfacing with C. Students will also find this a practical introduction to real-time programming with a generous collection of tried and tested programs. The pace of the book is such that the reader is encouraged to run the programs and experiment with C. The principles precede the applications in most cases in an attempt to provide genuine understanding and encourage further development. Readers will gain much from the hands-on experience the authors' approach provides, an approach designed to enable readers to climb steep learning curves with the minimum amount of assistance. The many programs included in the text provide the essential hands-on experience. Some of the programs inevitably become rather lengthy, so the source code used is available as a free download from the Newnes website.

This book is about the disassembly of x86 machine code into human-readable assembly, and the decompilation of x86 assembly code into human-readable C or C++ source code. Some topics covered will be common to all computer architectures, not just x86-compatible machines. What Will This Book Cover? This book is going to look in-depth at the disassembly and decompilation of x86 machine code and assembly code. We are going to look at the way programs are made using assemblers and compilers, and examine the way that assembly code is made from C or C++ source code. Using this knowledge, we will try to reverse the process. By examining common structures, such as data and control structures, we can find patterns that enable us to disassemble and decompile programs quickly. Who Is This Book For? This book is for readers at the undergraduate level with experience programming in x86 Assembly and C or C++. This book is not designed to teach assembly language programming, C or C++ programming, or compiler/assembler theory. What Are The Prerequisites? The reader should have a thorough understanding of x86 Assembly, C Programming, and possibly C++ Programming. This book is intended to increase the reader's understanding of the relationship between x86 machine code, x86 Assembly Language, and the C Programming Language. If you are not too familar with these topics, you may want to reread some of the above-mentioned books before continuing. What is Disassembly? Computer programs are written originally in a human readable code form, such as assembly language or a high-level language. These programs are then compiled into a binary format called machine code. This binary format is not directly readable or understandable by humans. Many programs, such as proprietary commercial programs, or very old legacy programs may not have the source code available to you. Programs frequently perform tasks that need to be duplicated, or need to be made to interact with other programs. Without the source code and without adequate documentation, these tasks can be difficult to accomplish. This book outlines tools and techniques for attempting to convert the raw machine code of an executable file into equivalent code in assembly language and the high-level languages C and C++. With the high-level code to perform a particular task, several things become possible: 1. Programs can be ported to new computer platforms, by compiling the source code in a different environment. 2. The algorithm used by a program can be determined. This allows other programs to make use of the same algorithm, or for updated versions of a program to be rewritten without needing to track down old copies of the source code. 3. Security holes and vulnerabilities can be identified and patched by users without needing access to the original source code. 4. New interfaces can be implemented for old programs. New components can be built on top of old components to speed development time and reduce the need to rewrite large volumes of code.","publisher":"CreateSpace","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Rl_LygAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":141,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Rl_LygAACAAJ&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=265&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780123884428","title":"Computers as Components: Principles of Embedded Computing System Design","author":"Marilyn Wolf","publish_date":"2012-06-12","description":"Computers as Components: Principles of Embedded Computing System Design, 3e, presents essential knowledge on embedded systems technology and techniques.

The three complete volumes published to date already comprise a unique and invaluable resource in programming theory and practice. Countless readers have spoken about the profound personal influence of Knuth's writings. Scientists have marveled at the beauty and elegance of his analysis, while practicing programmers have successfully applied his \"cookbook\" solutions to their day-to-day problems. All have admired Knuth for the breadth, clarity, accuracy, and good humor found in his books. To begin the fourth and later volumes of the set, and to update parts of the existing three, Knuth has created a series of small books called fascicles, which will be published t regular intervals. Each fascicle will encompass a section or more of wholly new or evised material. Ultimately, the content of these fascicles will be rolled up into the comprehensive, final versions of each volume, and the enormous undertaking that began in 1962 will be complete. Volume 1, Fascicle 1 This first fascicle updates The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 1, Third Edition: Fundamental Algorithms, and ultimately will become part of the fourth edition of that book. Specifically, it provides a programmer's introduction to the long-awaited MMIX, a RISC-based computer that replaces the original MIX, and describes the MMIX assembly language. The fascicle also presents new material on subroutines, coroutines, and interpretive routines.

Doaitse Swierstra","publish_date":"1999-03-10","description":"This is the second time that of ESOP has formed part of the ETAPS cluster of conferences, workshops, working group meetings and other associated activities. One of the results of colocatingso many conferences is a reduction in the number of possibilities to submit a paper to a European conference and the increased competition between conferences that occurs when boundaries between indiv- ual conferences have not yet become well established. This may have been the reason for the fact that only 44 submission were received this year. On the other hand we feel that the average quality of submissions has gone up, and thus the program committee was able to select 18 good papers, only one less than the year before. The program committee did not meet physically, and all discussion was done usinga Web-driven data base system.

It has become popular in recent years because of its simplicity, conciseness, and clarity. This book teaches functional programming as a way of thinking and problem solving, using Haskell, the most popular purely functional language. Rather than using the conventional (boring) mathematical examples commonly found in other programming language textbooks, the author uses examples drawn from multimedia applications, including graphics, animation, and computer music, thus rewarding the reader with working programs for inherently more interesting applications. Aimed at both beginning and advanced programmers, this tutorial begins with a gentle introduction to functional programming and moves rapidly on to more advanced topics. Details about progamming in Haskell are presented in boxes throughout the text so they can be easily found and referred to.","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=db42AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":null,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=db42AAAAQBAJ&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":3.5,"ratings_count":12,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=db42AAAAQBAJ&pg=PR10&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=280&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780470593349","title":"Trustworthy Compilers","author":"Vladimir O.

The transition from single to multicore processors, motivated by the need to increase performance while conserving power, has placed great responsibility on the shoulders of software engineers. In this new embedded multicore era, the toughest task is the development of code to support more sophisticated systems. This book provides embedded engineers with solid grounding in the skills required to develop software targeting multicore processors. Within the text, the author undertakes an in-depth exploration of performance analysis, and a close-up look at the tools of the trade. Both general multicore design principles and processor-specific optimization techniques are revealed. Detailed coverage of critical issues for multicore employment within embedded systems is provided, including the Threading Development Cycle, with discussions of analysis, design, development, debugging, and performance tuning of threaded applications. Software development techniques engendering optimal mobility and energy efficiency are highlighted through multiple case studies, which provide practical ‚Äúhow-to advice on implementing the latest multicore processors. Finally, future trends are discussed, including terascale, speculative multithreading, transactional memory, interconnects, and the software-specific implications of these looming architectural developments.

In the 1960s most computers filled an entire room, but the spacecraft‚Äôs computer was required to be compact and low power. Although people today find it difficult to accept that it was possible to control a spacecraft using such a ‚Äòprimitive‚Äô computer, it nevertheless had capabilities that are advanced even by today‚Äôs standards. This is the first book to fully describe the Apollo guidance computer‚Äôs architecture, instruction format and programs used by the astronauts. As a comprehensive account, it will span the disciplines of computer science, electrical and aerospace engineering. However, it will also be accessible to the ‚Äòspace enthusiast‚Äô. In short, the intention is for this to be the definitive account of the Apollo guidance computer. Frank O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs interest in the Apollo program began as a serious amateur historian. About 12 years ago, he began performing research and writing essays for the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal, and the Apollo Flight Journal. Much of this work centered on his primary interests, the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) and the Lunar Module. These Journals are generally considered the canonical online reference on the flights to the Moon. He was then asked to assist the curatorial staff in the creation of the Cradle of Aviation Museum, on Long Island, New York, where he helped prepare the Lunar Module simulator, a LM procedure trainer and an Apollo space suit for display. He regularly lectures on the Apollo computer and related topics to diverse groups, from NASA's computer engineering conferences, the IEEE/ACM, computer festivals and university student groups.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3fKzL0HfJp4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":440,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3fKzL0HfJp4C&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":6,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3fKzL0HfJp4C&pg=PA7&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=317&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9788170083559","title":"Comprehensive Computer and Languages","author":"Ashok Arora","publish_date":"2005-12-01","description":null,"publisher":"Firewall Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=s9Cn9nqq6dYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":636,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s9Cn9nqq6dYC&pg=PA278&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=318&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781402055300","title":"Processor Design: System-On-Chip Computing for ASICs and FPGAs","author":"Jari Nurmi","publish_date":"2007-07-26","description":"Here is an extremely useful book that provides insight into a number of different flavors of processor architectures and their design, software tool generation, implementation, and verification.

Bhattacharyya, Praveen K. Murthy, Edward A. Lee","publish_date":"1996-05-31","description":"Software Synthesis from Dataflow Graphs addresses the problem of generating efficient software implementations from applications specified as synchronous dataflow graphs for programmable digital signal processors (DSPs) used in embedded real- time systems. The advent of high-speed graphics workstations has made feasible the use of graphical block diagram programming environments by designers of signal processing systems. A particular subset of dataflow, called Synchronous Dataflow (SDF), has proven efficient for representing a wide class of unirate and multirate signal processing algorithms, and has been used as the basis for numerous DSP block diagram-based programming environments such as the Signal Processing Workstation from Cadence Design Systems, Inc., COSSAP from Synopsys¬Æ (both commercial tools), and the Ptolemy environment from the University of California at Berkeley. A key property of the SDF model is that static schedules can be determined at compile time. This removes the overhead of dynamic scheduling and is thus useful for real-time DSP programs where throughput requirements are often severe. Another constraint that programmable DSPs for embedded systems have is the limited amount of on-chip memory. Off-chip memory is not only expensive but is also slower and increases the power consumption of the system; hence, it is imperative that programs fit in the on-chip memory whenever possible. Software Synthesis from Dataflow Graphs reviews the state-of-the-art in constructing static, memory-optimal schedules for programs expressed as SDF graphs. Code size reduction is obtained by the careful organization of loops in the target code. Data buffering is optimized by constructing the loop hierarchy in provably optimal ways for many classes of SDF graphs. The central result is a uniprocessor scheduling framework that provably synthesizes the most compact looping structures, called single appearance schedules, for a certain class of SDF graphs. In addition, algorithms and heuristics are presented that generate single appearance schedules optimized for data buffering usage. Numerous practical examples and extensive experimental data are provided to illustrate the efficacy of these techniques.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=REu-HDWsvZUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":190,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=REu-HDWsvZUC&pg=PA10&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=323&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780123972965","title":"MSP430-based Robot Applications: A Guide to Developing Embedded Systems","author":"Dan Harres","publish_date":"2013-02-22","description":"This book provides a careful explanation of the basic areas of electronics and computer architecture, along with lots of examples, to demonstrate the interface, sensor design, programming and microcontroller peripheral setup necessary for embedded systems development.

The main target audience consists of newcomers to the field of numerical computation within Earth system sciences (students, researchers or scientific programmers). Furthermore, readers accustomed to other programming languages may also benefit from this work, by discovering how some programming techniques they are familiar with map to Fortran 95. The main goal is to enable readers to quickly start using Fortran 95 for writing useful programs. It also introduces a gradual discussion of Input/Output facilities relevant for Earth system sciences, from the simplest ones to the more advanced netCDF library (which has become a de facto standard for handling the massive datasets used within Earth system sciences). While related works already treat these disciplines separately (each often providing much more information than needed by the beginning practitioner), the reader finds in this book a shorter guide which links them. Compared to other books, this work provides a much more compact view of the language, while also placing the language-elements in a more applied setting, by providing examples related to numerical computing and more advanced Input/Output facilities for Earth system sciences. Naturally, the coverage of the programming language is relatively shallow, since many details are skipped. However, many of these details can be learned gradually by the practitioner, after getting an overview and some practice with the language through this book.","publisher":"Springer","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bZCeBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":250,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bZCeBQAAQBAJ&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bZCeBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=333&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9783540693291","title":"Languages and Compilers for Parallel Computing: 18th International Workshop, LCPC 2005, Hawthorne, NY, USA, October 20-22, 2005, Revised Selected Papers","author":"Eduard Ayguad√©","publish_date":"2006-12-22","description":"This book constitutes the thoroughly refereed post-proceedings of the 18th International Workshop on Languages and Compilers for Parallel Computing, LCPC 2005, held in Hawthorne, NY, USA in October 2005.

Many of the issues involved in software design apply to systems in general, including hardware systems, and the emphasis on software is not intended to be exclusive.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U079_ghi164C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":428,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U079_ghi164C&pg=PA366&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=335&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780135319482","title":"The 8051 Microcontroller: Hardware, Software, and Interfacing","author":"James W.

Just as packaged microprocessor ICs vary widely in their attributes, so do microprocessors packaged as IP cores. However, SOC designers still compare and select processor cores the way they previously compared and selected packaged microprocessor ICs. The big problem with this selection method is that it assumes that the laws of the microprocessor universe have remained unchanged for decades. This assumption is no longer valid. Processor cores for SOC designs can be far more plastic than microprocessor ICs for board-level system designs. Shaping these cores for specific applications produces much better processor efficiency and much lower system clock rates. Together, Tensilica‚Äôs Xtensa and Diamond processor cores constitute a family of software-compatible microprocessors covering an extremely wide performance range from simple control processors, to DSPs, to 3-way superscalar processors. Yet all of these processors use the same software-development tools so that programmers familiar with one processor in the family can easily switch to another. This book emphasizes a processor-centric MPSOC (multiple-processor SOC) design style shaped by the realities of the 21st-century and nanometer silicon. It advocates the assignment of tasks to firmware-controlled processors whenever possible to maximize SOC flexibility, cut power dissipation, reduce the size and number of hand-built logic blocks, shrink the associated verification effort, and minimize the overall design risk. ¬∑ An essential, no-nonsense guide to the design of 21st-century mega-gate SOCs using nanometer silicon. ¬∑ Discusses today's key issues affecting SOC design, based on author's decades of personal experience in developing large digital systems as a design engineer while working at Hewlett-Packard's Desktop Computer Division and at EDA workstation pioneer Cadnetix, and covering such topics as an award-winning technology journalist and editor-in-chief for EDN magazine and the Microprocessor Report. ¬∑ Explores conventionally accepted boundaries and perceived limits of processor-based system design and then explodes these artificial constraints through a fresh outlook on and discussion of the special abilities of processor cores designed specifically for SOC design. ¬∑ Thorough exploration of the evolution of processors and processor cores used for ASIC and SOC design with a look at where the industry has come from, and where it's going. ¬∑ Easy-to-understand explanations of the capabilities of configurable and extensible processor cores through a detailed examination of Tensilica's configurable, extensible Xtensa processor core and six pre-configured Diamond cores. ¬∑ The most comprehensive assessment available of the practical aspects of configuring and using multiple processor cores to achieve very difficult and ambitious SOC price, performance, and power design goals.","publisher":"Academic Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DwXOaCQ2gXYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":344,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DwXOaCQ2gXYC&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DwXOaCQ2gXYC&pg=PA75&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=348&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780763717636","title":"Programming and Problem Solving with Visual Basic .NET","author":"Nell B.

Nonetheless, a novice programmer should be able to read along and pick up the language, although access to a more knowledgeable colleague will help.\"","publisher":"Prentice Hall","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yi5FI5QcdmYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":285,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Yi5FI5QcdmYC&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":2,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Yi5FI5QcdmYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=379&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"CP/M DiskGuide","author":"Curtis A.

It provides practical techniques and alternatives for designing solutions to data processing problems both in commerce and in research purposes. It offers an excellent introduction to the tools and elements of design used in microprogrammed state machines, and incoporates the necessary background in number systems, hardware building blocks, assemblers for use in preparing control programs, and tools and components for assemblers . The author conducts an in-depth examination of first- and second-level microprogrammed state machines. He promotes a top-down approach that examines algorithms mathematically to exploit the simplifications resulting from choosing the proper representation and application of algebraic manipulation. The steps involved in the cycle of design and simulation steps are demonstrated through an example of running a computer through a simulation. Other topics covered in Microprogrammed State Machine Design include a discussion of simulation methods, the development and use of assembler language processors, and comparisons among various hardware implementations, such as the Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) and the Digital Signal Processor (DSP). As a text and guide, Microprogrammed State Machine Design will interest students in the computer sciences, computer architectects and engineers, systems programmers and analysts, and electrical engineers.","publisher":"CRC Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fyX788N-xokC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":512,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fyX788N-xokC&pg=PA132&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=381&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780835931687","title":"Introduction to computer science using the TURING programming language","author":"Richard C.

The Common Language Runtime (CLR) provides a solid foundation for developers to build various types of applications. Whether a developer is writing an ASP.NET application, a Windows Forms application, a Web Service, a mobile code application, a distributed application, or an application that combines several of these application models, the CLR provides huge benefits such as simplified development and the ability to integrate code written in various languages. This book is a high-end comprehensive reference to the capability of the CLR. The samples in the book have been written so that they not only illustrate a principle but give the reader a springboard to quickly translate the sample to practical, real-world applications. After reading this book, readers will be able to significantly increase their productivity by comfortably using the power and expressiveness of the Common Language Runtime in their applications. This book will take the reader beyond the syntax of C# to using and understanding the CLR to build secure, maintainable, and high performance applications.","publisher":"Sams Publishing","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3059QRxPNQcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":997,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3059QRxPNQcC&pg=PA133&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=402&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780534391775","title":"Introduction to Embedded Microcomputer Systems: Motorola 6811 and 6812 Simulation","author":"Jonathan W.

Excerpt: Atari BASIC is a BASIC interpreter for the Atari 8-bit family of 6502-based home computers. The interpreter originally shipped on an 8 KB cartridge; on later XL/XE model computers it was built in, with an option to disable it, and started when the machines were booted with no other cartridges in place. The complete commented source code and design specifications of Atari BASIC were published as a book in 1983. This marked the first time source code was made available for a commercial language. The output of a small program using GRAPHICS 2 mode. The text says in READY. In the nomenclature of the time when these machines were designed, \"K\" was taken to mean one kilobyte, so that is how it is expressed here. Similarly, further, on the family of processors use by Atari machines, in the assembly language \"$\" introduced a hexadecimal number, or it was suffixed subscripted with its radix, so, for example, \"one hundred and twenty-eight\" is \"12810,\" \"$80,\" or \"8016.\" If a number is expressed with no radix, decimal (10) is assumed, and a leading 0 does not imply octal.

Their rules of thumb and coaching advice are great blueprints for new and experienced software engineering managers alike.‚Äù ‚ÄîTom Conrad, CTO, Pandora ‚ÄúI wish I‚Äôd had this material available years ago. I see lots and lots of ‚Äòmeat‚Äô in here that I‚Äôll use over and over again as I try to become a better manager. The writing style is right on, and I love the personal anecdotes.‚Äù ‚ÄîSteve Johnson, VP, Custom Solutions, DigitalFish All too often, software development is deemed unmanageable. The news is filled with stories of projects that have run catastrophically over schedule and budget. Although adding some formal discipline to the development process has improved the situation, it has by no means solved the problem. How can it be, with so much time and money spent to get software development under control, that it remains so unmanageable? In Managing the Unmanageable: Rules, Tools, and Insights for Managing Software People and Teams , Mickey W. Mantle and Ron Lichty answer that persistent question with a simple observation: You first must make programmers and software teams manageable. That is, you need to begin by understanding your people‚Äîhow to hire them, motivate them, and lead them to develop and deliver great products. Drawing on their combined seventy years of software development and management experience, and highlighting the insights and wisdom of other successful managers, Mantle and Lichty provide the guidance you need to manage people and teams in order to deliver software successfully. Whether you are new to software management, or have already been working in that role, you will appreciate the real-world knowledge and practical tools packed into this guide.","publisher":"Addison-Wesley","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jZSS2uUi2zMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":464,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jZSS2uUi2zMC&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":3.5,"ratings_count":3,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jZSS2uUi2zMC&pg=PA108&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=410&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781439825372","title":"Scientific Computing with Multicore and Accelerators","author":"Jakub Kurzak, David A. Bader, Jack Dongarra","publish_date":"2010-12-07","description":"The hybrid/heterogeneous nature of future microprocessors and large high-performance computing systems will result in a reliance on two major types of components: multicore/manycore central processing units and special purpose hardware/massively parallel accelerators. While these technologies have numerous benefits, they also pose substantial performance challenges for developers, including scalability, software tuning, and programming issues. Researchers at the Forefront Reveal Results from Their Own State-of-the-Art Work Edited by some of the top researchers in the field and with contributions from a variety of international experts, Scientific Computing with Multicore and Accelerators focuses on the architectural design and implementation of multicore and manycore processors and accelerators, including graphics processing units (GPUs) and the Sony Toshiba IBM (STI) Cell Broadband Engine (BE) currently used in the Sony PlayStation 3. The book explains how numerical libraries, such as LAPACK, help solve computational science problems; explores the emerging area of hardware-oriented numerics; and presents the design of a fast Fourier transform (FFT) and a parallel list ranking algorithm for the Cell BE. It covers stencil computations, auto-tuning, optimizations of a computational kernel, sequence alignment and homology, and pairwise computations. The book also evaluates the portability of drug design applications to the Cell BE and illustrates how to successfully exploit the computational capabilities of GPUs for scientific applications. It concludes with chapters on dataflow frameworks, the Charm++ programming model, scan algorithms, and a portable intracore communication framework. Explores the New Computational Landscape of Hybrid Processors By offering insight into the process of constructing and effectively using the technology, this volume provides a thorough and practical introduction to the area of hybrid computing. It discusses introductory concepts and simple examples of parallel computing, logical and performance debugging for parallel computing, and advanced topics and issues related to the use and building of many applications.","publisher":"CRC Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d6LMBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":514,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d6LMBQAAQBAJ&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d6LMBQAAQBAJ&pg=PR17&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=411&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780470535998","title":"Model-Driven Development with Executable UML","author":"Dragan Milicev","publish_date":"2009-06-22","description":null,"publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PUri212VXo0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":720,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PUri212VXo0C&pg=PR21&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=412&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780130094025","title":"C++: a Dialogue: Programming with the C++ Standard Library","author":"Steve Heller","publish_date":"2003","description":"Annotation \"Unlike many beginners' books, C++: A Dialog uses industry-standard C++ and the latest standard libraries - giving you skills you can use with any standard C++ toolset, in any programming environment.

In assembly language programming, the function prologue is a few lines of code at the beginning of a function, which prepare the stack and registers for use within the function. Similarly, the function epilogue appears at the end of the function, and restores the stack and registers to the state they were in before the function was called. The prologue and epilogue are not a part of the assembly language itself; they represent a convention used by assembly language programmers, and compilers of many higher-level languages. They are fairly rigid, having the same form in each function.","publisher":null,"image_url":null,"total_pages":100,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wMVQYAAACAAJ&dq=assembly+language,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=418&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"The Peter Norton Programmer's guide to the IBM PC.","author":"Peter Norton","publish_date":"1985-06","description":"A gold mine of insights, techniques and technical data, this guide includes information on the similarities and differences among IBM's five personal computers, plus tips for programming in assembly language, BASIC, C and Pascal.
