Often in programming books, the information can be hidden in a vast sea of words. As a programmer who has over the years used a dozen programming languages, the author understands it can sometimes be difficult to slog through another 1,000-page book of dense text to learn a new language. There are likely many other programmers who feel the same way. To address this situation, this book explains C# 5.0 using figures; short, focused code samples; and clear, concise explanations. Figures are of prime importance in this book. While teaching programming seminars, Daniel Solis found that he could almost watch the light bulbs going on over the students’ heads as he drew the figures on the whiteboard. In this text, he has distilled each important concept into simple but accurate illustrations. The visual presentation of the content will give you an understanding of C# that’s not possible with text alone. For something as intricate and precise as a programming language, however, there must be text as well as figures. But rather than long, wordy explanations, Solis has used short, concise descriptions and bulleted lists to make each important piece of information visually distinct. By the end of this book, you’ll have a thorough working knowledge of all aspects of the C# language, whether you’re a novice programmer or a seasoned veteran of other languages. If you want a long, leisurely, verbose explanation of the language, this is not the book for you. But if you want a concise, thorough, visual presentation of C# 5.0, this is just what you’re looking for.","publisher":"Apress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qgq8T4X3erIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":764,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qgq8T4X3erIC&dq=c%23,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":2,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qgq8T4X3erIC&pg=PA48&dq=c%23,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=35&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780080491950","title":"Network programming in .NET: C# & Visual Basic .NET","author":"Fiach Reid","publish_date":"2004-07-01","description":"The purpose of this book is to provide tools to design and implement network-orientated applications in .NET.

Also covered are instructions for how to greatly increase your graphics capabilities using transformations. Transformations allow you to move, stretch, or rotate graphics. They also let you work in coordinate systems that make sense for your application. You will also learn how to use all of these techniques in printouts. The author describes the sequence of events that produce a printout and shows how to generate and preview printouts. The final sections describe two powerful new graphic tools that were introduced with .NET Framework 3.0: WPF graphics and FlowDocuments. WPF applications can use XAML graphic commands to declaratively draw and fill the same kinds of shapes that a program can draw by using graphics objects. Finally, a discussion on the FlowDocument object shows you how to define items that should be flowed across multiple pages as space permits. This lets you display text, graphics, controls, and other items that automatically flow across page breaks. FlowDocument viewers make displaying these documents easy for you, and simplifies the user's reading of the documents. This Wrox Blox also contains 35 example programs written in C# 2008, although most of the code works in previous versions of C# as well. The most notable exceptions are WPF graphics and FlowDocuments, both of which require WPF provided in .NET Framework 3.0 and later.","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QJ0XLsHgircC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":147,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QJ0XLsHgircC&dq=c%23,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QJ0XLsHgircC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c%23,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=65&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781430242543","title":"Pro ASP.NET 4.5 in C#","author":"Adam Freeman, Matthew MacDonald, Mario Szpuszta","publish_date":"2013-02-17","description":"ASP.NET 4.5 remains Microsoft's preferred technology for creating dynamic websites, providing developers with unrivalled power and flexibility.

It has quickly become the next must-have skill for .NET developers. Pro LINQ: Language Integrated Query in C# 2010 is all about code. Literally, this book starts with code and ends with code. Most books show the simplest examples of how to use a method, but they so rarely show how to use the more complex prototypes. This book is different. Demonstrating the overwhelming majority of LINQ operators and prototypes, it is a veritable treasury of LINQ examples. Rather than obscure the relevant LINQ principles in code examples by focusing on a demonstration application you have no interest in writing, this book cuts right to the chase of each LINQ operator, method, or class. However, where complexity is necessary to truly demonstrate an issue, the examples are right there in the thick of it. For example, code samples demonstrating how to handle concurrency conflicts actually create concurrency conflicts so you can step through the code and see them unfold. Face it, most technical books, while informative, are dull. LINQ need not be dull. Written with a sense of humor, this book will attempt to entertain you on your journey through the wonderland of LINQ and C# 2010. What you’ll learn How to leverage all the new LINQ relevant C# 2008 language features including extension methods, lambda expressions, anonymous data types, and partial methods. How to use LINQ to Objects to query in-memory data collections such as arrays, ArrayLists, and Lists to retrieve the data you want. Why some queries are deferred, how a deferred query can bite you, and how you can make deferred queries work for you. How to use LINQ to XML to revolutionize your creation, manipulation, and searching of XML data. How to query DataSets with LINQ to DataSet so you can coexist with legacy code and use LINQ to query databases other than SQL Server. How to query Databases with LINQ to SQL, write your own entity classes, and understand how to handle concurrency conflicts. Who this book is for This book is written for the proficient C# developer, but you do not need to be up on all the latest C# features to understand the material. When you finish this book, you will have a much greater understanding of the latest C# features.

C# 3.0 in a Nutshell gets right to the point, covering the essentials of language syntax and usage as well as the parts of the .NET base class libraries you need to build working applications. But unlike earlier editions, this book is now organized entirely around concepts and use cases, providing greater depth and readability. C# 3.0 introduces the most significant enhancements yet to the programming language, and C# 3.0 in a Nutshell delves deep into the subject while assuming minimal prior knowledge of C#-making it accessible to anyone with a reasonable background in programming. In addition to the language, the book covers the .NET CLR and the core Framework assemblies, along with the unified querying syntax called Language Integrated Query (LINQ), which bridges the traditional divide between programs and their data sources. Free of clutter and long introductions, this book provides a map of C# 3.0 knowledge in a succinct and unified style: Opening chapters concentrate purely on C#, starting with the basics of syntax, types and variables, and finishing with advanced topics such as unsafe code and preprocessor directives Later chapters cover the core .NET 3.5 Framework, including such topics as LINQ, XML, collections, I/O and networking, memory management, reflection, attributes, security, threading, application domains and native interoperability Designed as a handbook for daily use, C# 3.0 in a Nutshell is an ideal companion to any of the vast array of books that focus on an applied technology such as WPF, ASP.NET, or WCF. The areas of the language and .NET Framework that such books omit, this one covers in detail.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_Y0rWd-Q2xkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":864,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":10,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_Y0rWd-Q2xkC&pg=PA725&dq=c%23,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=98&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780080878072","title":"Computational Finance Using C and C#","author":"George Levy","publish_date":"2008-06-13","description":"In Computational Finance Using C and C# George Levy raises computational finance to the next level using the languages of both standard C and C#.

After reading this book, you will be armed with the knowledge required to feel confident in learning more. You’ll have what it takes to at least look at code without your head spinning. Writing a massive multiplayer online role-playing game is quite hard, of course, but learning how to write a simple behavior isn’t. Like drawing, you start off with the basics such as spheres and cubes. After plenty of practice, you’ll be able to create a real work of art. This applies to writing code—you start off with basic calculations, then move on to the logic that drives a complex game. By the end of this book, you will have the skills to be a capable programmer, or at least know what is involved with how to read and write code. Although you could go online and find videos and tutorials, there is a distinct advantage when it comes to learning things in order and in one place. Most online tutorials for C# are scattered, disordered, and incohesive.

C# for Java Programmers will prepare readers for the .NET framework by building on what they already know about object-oriented languages and give them the means to maintain their flexibility and effectiveness in an un-certain marketplace. This book will compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of both Java and C# to allow programmers to make their own decisions regarding what each language is best used for. Whatever your feelings are about Microsoft and its .NET initiative, there can be no denying that C# is here to stay. The C# language, a close cousin to Java, is a new object-oriented programming language (OOPL) designed to work within the .NET framework. It improves upon many of the vague or ill-defined areas of C++ that frequently lead programmers into trouble. C# is a strongly-typed, object-oriented language designed to give the optimum blend of simplicity, expressiveness, and performance. Written specifically for Java programmers. C# for Java Programmers is not an introductory guide to C#, but builds on what Java programmers already know about object-oriented languages to give them an efficient means for making in-roads to the .NET framework. Compare and Contrast. This book will compare and contrast many of the advantages and drawbacks of Java and C# to allow programmers to make informed, intelligent decisions based on the unique uses of each language. Make your own in-depth analysis of C# and Java with the Syngress Wallet CD.

This book is best suitable for first time C# readers, Covers all fast track topics of C# for all Computer Science students and Professionals. This book is targeted toward those who have little or no programming experience or who might be picking up C# as a second language. The book has been structured and written with a purpose: to get you productive as quickly as possible. I’ve used my experiences in writing applications with C# and teaching C# to create a book that I hope cuts through the fluff and teaches you what you need to know. All too often, authors fall into the trap of focusing on the technology rather than on the practical application of the technology. I’ve worked hard to keep this book focused on teaching you practical skills that you can apply immediately toward a development project. This book is divided into ten Chapters, each of which focuses on a different aspect of developing applications with C#. These parts generally follow the flow of tasks you’ll perform as you begin creating your own programs with C#. I recommend that you read them in the order in which they appear. Using C#, this book develops the concepts and theory of Building the Program Logic and Interfaces analysis, Exceptions, Delegates and Events and other important things in a gradual, step-by-step manner, proceeding from concrete examples to abstract principles. Standish covers a wide range of both traditional and contemporary software engineering topics. This is a handy guide of sorts for any computer science engineering Students, Thinking In C# Programming is a solution bank for various complex problems related to C# and .NET. It can be used as a reference manual by Computer Science Engineering students. This Book also covers all aspects of B.TECH CS, IT, and BCA and MCA, BSC IT. Preview introduced programmers to a new era called functional programming. C# focused on bridging the gap between programming languages and databases. This book covers all the language features from the first version through C# . It also provides you with the essentials of using Visual Studio 2005 to let you enjoy its capabilities and save you time by using features such as IntelliSense. Learning a new programming language can be intimidating. If you’ve never programmed before, the act of typing seemingly cryptic text to produce sleek and powerful applications probably seems like a black art, and you might wonder how you’ll ever learn everything you need to know. The answer is, of course, one step at a time. The first step to learning a language is the same as that of any other activity: building confidence. Programming is part art and part science. Although it might seem like magic, it’s more akin to illusion: After you know how things work a lot of the mysticism goes away, freeing you to focus on the mechanics necessary to produce any given desired result.

With Learn 2D Game Development with C#, you'll learn your way around the universal building blocks of game development, and how to put them together to create a real working game. C# is increasingly becoming the language of choice for new game developers. Productive and easier to learn than C++, C# lets you get your games working quickly and safely without worrying about tricky low-level details like memory management. This book uses MonoGame, an open source framework that's powerful, free to use and easy to handle, to further reduce low-level details, meaning you can concentrate on the most interesting and universal aspects of a game development: frame, camera, objects and particles, sprites, and the logic and simple physics that determines how they interact. In each chapter, you'll explore one of these key elements of game development in the context of a working game, learn how to implement the example for yourself, and integrate it into your own game library. At the end of the book, you’ll put everything you’ve learned together to build your first full working game! And what’s more, MonoGame is designed for maximum cross-platform support, so once you’ve mastered the fundamentals in this book, you’ll be ready to explore and publish games on a wide range of platforms including Windows 8, MAC OSX, Windows Phone, iOS, Android, and Playstation Mobile.

That's because C# is not only essential for making .NET work, it's a big way for Microsoft to attract millions of Java, C and C++ developers to the platform. And C# has definitely made some inroads. Because of its popularity among developers, the language received standardization from ECMA International, making it possible to port C# applications to other platforms. To bolster its appeal, C# 2.0 has undergone some key changes as part of Visual Studio 2005 that will make development with .NET quicker and easier. That's precisely what Visual C# 2005: A Developer's Notebook allows you to do. There are some great new features in C# and this unique \"all lab, no lecture\" guide covers them all with 50 hands-on projects. Each project explores a new feature, with emphasis on changes that increase productivity, simplify programming tasks, and add functionality to applications. C#'s component-based design combines the productivity of Microsoft's popular Visual Basic with the raw power of C++ for web-based applications. Many reviewers note a similarity between C# and Java--in fact, a new feature that took the Java development team five years to incorporate into Java is now available in C# 2.0. Called \"generics\", this feature enables developers to reuse and customize their existing code, so they can dramatically cut down the time it takes to develop new applications. Visual C# 2005: A Developer's Notebook is full of no-nonsense code without the usual page-filling commentary. You'll find suggestions for further experimentation, links to on-line documentation, plus practical notes and warnings. The book also tells developers how to acquire, install and configure Visual Studio 2005. Are you a coder to the core?

A little knowledge of HTML is useful, but by no means essential as all the concepts that you need in order to create dynamic ASP.NET web sites are presented and explained in full. What you will learn from this book This book will teach you how to build tailored ASP.NET web sites from the ground up. It covers the following broad topics (see the book's Introduction for a more detailed explanation): The early part of the book is dedicated to familiarizing you with the anatomy and basic functionality of HTML, XML, ASP.NET, the .NET Framework, and C#. This done, it looks at the way in which they can be used together to create flexible web sites. The second part of the book introduces object-oriented programming which is crucial to maximizing your benefit from .NET. Ideas are explained in detail with many programmatic examples and real-world analogies. Having laid the groundwork we then progress to discussing the technologies and techniques that ASP.NET can draw upon to increase its functionality. This includes ADO.NET for data source access, Web Services for inter-web site communication and the encapsulation ideas of Server and User Controls to ease code maintenance and reuse. The book concludes by considering the ways in which you can optimize your ASP.NET sites to increase their speed, security, and robustness; detailed advice on debugging is also included. \"ASP.NET is a logical and powerful progression for developers - it's the future for web development.

We assume you have a general understanding of Web technologies, such as previous versions of ASP.NET, Active Server Pages 2.0/3.0, or JavaServer Pages. If you understand the basics of Web programming, you should not have much trouble following along with this book's content. If you are brand new to ASP.NET, be sure to check out Beginning ASP.NET 4: In C# and VB by Imar Spaanjaars (Wiley Publishing, Inc., 2010) to help you understand the basics. In addition to working with Web technologies, we also assume that you understand basic programming constructs, such as variables, For Each loops, and object-oriented programming. You may also be wondering whether this book is for the Visual Basic developer or the C# developer. We are happy to say that it is for both! When the code differs substantially, this book provides examples in both VB and C#. This book explores the 4 release of ASP.NET. It covers each major new feature included in ASP.NET 4 in detail. The following list tells you something about the content of each chapter. Chapter 1, ″Application and Page Frameworks.″ The first chapter covers the frameworks of ASP.NET applications as well as the structure and frameworks provided for single ASP.NET pages. This chapter shows you how to build ASP.NET applications using IIS or the built-in Web server that comes with Visual Studio 2010. This chapter also shows you the folders and files that are part of ASP.NET. It discusses ways to compile code and shows you how to perform cross-page posting. This chapter ends by showing you easy ways to deal with your classes from within Visual Studio 2010. Chapters 2, 3, and 4. These three chapters are grouped together because they all deal with server controls. This batch of chapters starts by examining the idea of the server control and its pivotal role in ASP.NET development. In addition to looking at the server control framework, these chapters delve into the plethora of server controls that are at your disposal for ASP.NET development projects. Chapter 2, ″ASP.NET Server Controls and Client-Side Scripts,″ looks at the basics of working with server controls. Chapter 3, ″ASP.NET Web Server Controls,″ covers the controls that have been part of the ASP.NET technology since its initial release and the controls that have been added in each of the ASP.NET releases. Chapter 4, ″Validation Server Controls,″ describes a special group of server controls: those for validation. Chapter 5, ″Working with Master Pages.″ Master pages provide a means of creating templated pages that enable you to work with the entire application, as opposed to single pages. This chapter examines the creation of these templates and how to apply them to your content pages throughout an ASP.NET application. Chapter 6, ″Themes and Skins.″ The Cascading Style Sheet files you are allowed to use in ASP.NET 1.0/1.1 are simply not adequate in many regards, especially in the area of server controls. This chapter looks at how to deal with the styles that your applications require and shows you how to create a centrally managed look-and-feel for all the pages of your application by using themes and the skin files that are part of a theme. Chapter 7, ″Data Binding.″ One of the more important tasks of ASP.NET is presenting data, and this chapter looks at the underlying capabilities that enable you to work with the data programmatically before issuing the data to a control. Chapter 8, ″Data Management with ADO.NET.″ This chapter presents the ADO.NET data model provided by ASP.NET, which allows you to handle the retrieval, updating, and deleting of data quickly and logically. Chapter 9, ″Querying with LINQ.″ The.NET Framework 4 includes a nice access model language called LINQ. LINQ is a set of extensions to the .NET Framework that encompass language-integrated query, set, and transform operations. This chapter introduces you to LINQ and how to effectively use this feature in your Web applications today. Chapter 10, ″Working with XML and LINQ to XML.″ The .NET Framework and ASP.NET 4 have many capabilities built into their frameworks that enable you to easily extract, create, manipulate, and store XML. This chapter takes a close look at the XML technologies built into ASP.NET and the underlying .NET Framework. Chapter 11, ″Introduction to the Provider Model.″ The provider model is built into ASP.NET to make the lives of developers so much easier and more productive than ever before. This chapter gives an overview of this provider model and how it is used throughout ASP.NET 4. Chapter 12, ″Extending the Provider Model.″ After an introduction of the provider model, this chapter looks at some of the ways to extend the provider model found in ASP.NET 4. This chapter also reviews a couple of sample extensions to the provider model. Chapter 13, ″Site Navigation.″ Most developers do not simply develop single pages—they build applications. One of the application capabilities provided by ASP.NET 4 is the site navigation system covered in this chapter. Chapter 14, ″Personalization.″ Developers are always looking for ways to store information pertinent to the end user. After it is stored, this personalization data has to be persisted for future visits or for grabbing other pages within the same application. The ASP.NET team developed a way to store this information—the ASP.NET personalization system. The great thing about this system is that you configure the entire behavior of the system from the web.config file. Chapter 15, ″Membership and Role Management.″ This chapter covers the membership and role management system developed to simplify adding authentication and authorization to your ASP.NET applications. This chapter focuses on using the web.config file for controlling how these systems are applied, as well as on the server controls that work with the underlying systems. Chapter 16, ″Portal Frameworks and Web Parts.″ This chapter explains Web Parts—a way of encapsulating pages into smaller and more manageable objects. Chapter 17, ″HTML and CSS Design with ASP.NET.″ Visual Studio 2010 places a lot of focus on building a CSS-based Web. This chapter takes a close look at how you can effectively work with HTML and CSS design for your ASP.NET applications. Chapter 18, ″ASP.NET AJAX.″ AJAX is an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. In Web application development, it signifies the capability to build applications that make use of the XMLHttpRequest object. Visual Studio 2010 contains the ability to build AJAX-enabled ASP.NET applications from the default install of the IDE. This chapter takes a look at this way to build your applications. Chapter 19, ″ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit.″ Along with the capabilities to build ASP.NET applications that make use of the AJAX technology, a series of controls is available to make the task rather simple. This chapter takes a good look at the ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit and how to use this toolkit with your applications today. Chapter 20, ″Security.″ This chapter discusses security beyond the membership and role management features provided by ASP.NET 4. This chapter provides an in-depth look at the authentication and authorization mechanics inherent in the ASP.NET technology, as well as HTTP access types and impersonations. Chapter 21, ″State Management.″ Because ASP.NET is a request-response–based technology, state management and the performance of requests and responses take on significant importance. This chapter introduces these two separate but important areas of ASP.NET development. Chapter 22, ″Caching.″ Because of the request-response nature of ASP.NET, caching (storing previous generated results, images, and pages) on the server becomes rather important to the performance of your ASP.NET applications. This chapter looks at some of the advanced caching capabilities provided by ASP.NET, including the SQL cache invalidation feature which is part of ASP.NET 4. This chapter also takes a look at object caching and object caching extensibility. Chapter 23, ″Debugging and Error Handling.″ This chapter tells you how to properly structure error handling within your applications. It also shows you how to use various debugging techniques to find errors that your applications might contain. Chapter 24, ″File I/O and Streams.″ This chapter takes a close look at working with various file types and streams that might come into your ASP.NET applications. Chapter 25, ″User and Server Controls.″ Not only can you use the plethora of server controls that come with ASP.NET, but you can also use the same framework these controls use and build your own. This chapter describes building your own server controls and how to use them within your applications. Chapter 26, ″Modules and Handlers.″ This chapter looks at two methods of manipulating the way ASP.NET processes HTTP requests: HttpModule and HttpHandler. Each method provides a unique level of access to the underlying processing of ASP.NET, and each can be a powerful tool for creating Web applications. Chapter 27, \"ASP.NET MVC.\" ASP.NET MVC is the latest major addition to ASP.NET and has generated a lot of excitement from the development community. ASP.NET MVC supplies you with the means to create ASP.NET using the Model-View-Controller models that many developers expect. ASP.NET MVC provides developers with the testability, flexibility, and maintainability in the applications they build. It is important to remember that ASP.NET MVC is not meant to be a replacement to the ASP.NET everyone knows and loves, but instead is simply a different way to construct your applications. Chapter 28, ″Using Business Objects.″ Invariably, you are going to have components created with previous technologies that you do not want to rebuild but that you do want to integrate into new ASP.NET applications. If this is the case, the .NET Framework makes incorporating your previous COM components into your applications fairly simple and straightforward. This chapter also shows you how to build .NET components instead of turning to the previous COM component architecture. Chapter 29, ″ADO.NET Entity Framework.″ The inclusion of the ADO.NET Entity Framework in ASP.NET makes mapping objects from the database to the objects within your code significantly simpler. Using Visual Studio 2010, you are able to visually design your entity data models and then very easily access these models from code allowing the ADO.NET Entity Framework to handle the connections and transactions to the underlying database. Chapter 30, ″ASP.NET Dynamic Data.″ This feature in ASP.NET 4 allows you to quickly and easily put together a reporting and data entry application from your database. You are also able to take these same capabilities and incorporate them into a pre-existing application. Chapter 31, ″Working with Services.″ This chapter reveals the ease not only of building XML Web services, but consuming them in an ASP.NET application. This chapter then ventures further by describing how to build XML Web services that utilize SOAP headers and how to consume this particular type of service. Another feature in ASP.NET, ADO.NET Data Services, allows you to create a RESTful service layer using an Entity Data Model. Using this capability, you can quickly set up a service layer that allows you to expose your content as AtomPub or JSON, which will allow the consumer to completely interact with the underlying database. Chapter 32, ″Building Global Applications.″ ASP.NET provides an outstanding way to address the internationalization of Web applications. Changes to the API, the addition of capabilities to the server controls, and even Visual Studio itself equip you to do the extra work required to more easily bring your application to an international audience. This chapter looks at some of the important items to consider when building your Web applications for the world. Chapter 33, ″Configuration.″ This chapter teaches you to modify the capabilities and behaviors of ASP.NET using the various configuration files at your disposal. Chapter 34, ″Instrumentation.″ ASP.NET gives you greater capability to apply instrumentation techniques to your applications. The ASP.NET Framework includes performance counters, the capability to work with the Windows Event Tracing system, possibilities for application tracing (covered in Chapter 23 of this book), and the most exciting part of this discussion—a health monitoring system that allows you to log a number of different events over an application's lifetime. This chapter takes an in-depth look at this health monitoring system. Chapter 35, ″Administration and Management.″ This chapter provides an overview of the GUI tools that come with ASP.NET today that enable you to manage your Web applications easily and effectively. Chapter 36, ″Packaging and Deploying ASP.NET Applications.″ So you have built an ASP.NET application—now what? This chapter takes the building process one step further and shows you how to package your ASP.NET applications for easy deployment. Many options are available for working with the installers and compilation model to change what you are actually giving your customers. Appendix A, ″Migrating Older ASP.NET Projects.″ This appendix focuses on migrating ASP.NET 1.x, 2.0, or 3.5 applications to the 4 Framework. Appendix B, ″ASP.NET Ultimate Tools.″ Based on Scott Hanselman's annual Tools pick blog posting, many of the tools here will expedite your development process and, in many cases, make you a better developer. Appendix C, ″Silverlight 3 and ASP.NET.″ Silverlight is a means to build fluid applications using XAML. This technology enables developers with really rich vector-based applications. Appendix D, \"Dynamic Types and Languages.\" As of the release of ASP.NET 4, you can now build your Web applications using IronRuby and IronPython. This appendix takes a quick look at using dynamic languages in building your Web applications.

Starting from very first principles it will end up giving you an excellent grounding in the writing of C# code and scripts. Overview You've actually been creating scripts in your mind your whole life, you just didn't realize it. Apply this logical ability to write Unity C# scriptsLearn how to use the two primary building blocks for writing scripts: the variable and the method. They're not mysterious or intimidating, just a simple form of substitutionLearn about GameObjects and Component objects as well as the vital communication between these objects using Dot Syntax. It's easy, just like addressing a postal letterStay logically organized by utilizing a State Machine for your code. Use the simple concept of a State to control your Unity project. You will definitely save time by knowing where your code is locatedWith your new knowledge of coding, you will be able to look at Unity's Scripting Reference code examples with confidence In Detail For the absolute beginner to any concept of programming, writing a script can appear to be an impossible hurdle to overcome. The truth is, there are only three simple concepts to understand: 1) having some type of information; 2) using the information; and 3) communicating the information. Each of these concepts is very simple and extremely important. These three concepts are combined to access the feature set provided by Unity. \"Learning C# by Developing Games with Unity 3D\" assumes that you know nothing about programming concepts. First you will learn the absolute basics of programming using everyday examples that you already know. As you progress through the book, you will find that C# is not a foreign language after all, because you already know the words. With a few keywords and using substitution, before you know it, you'll be thinking in code. The book starts by explaining in simple terms the three concepts you need for writing C# code and scripts: 1) variables to hold information; 2) methods (functions) to use the information; and 3) Dot Syntax to communicate the information where it's needed. The book builds on these concepts to open up the world of C# coding and Unity scripting. You will use this new power to access the features provided in Unity's Scripting Reference. The first half of this book is devoted to the code writing beginner. The concepts of variables, methods, Dot Syntax, and decision processing are fully explained. Since C# is an actual programming language, we take advantage of this to develop a State Machine to help control and organize each phase of a Unity project. Once the basic programming concepts are established and we have some State Machine organization, the features and power of Unity are accessed using the Scripting Reference. The goal of \"Learning C# by Developing Games with Unity 3D\" is to teach to you how to use the Unity Scripting Reference. What you will learn from this book Understand what a variable is and how it worksLearn about methods and functions is and how they are used to manipulate informationLearn the concept of an object, a component of a GameObject, and the class they come fromLearn about communication between objects using Dot SyntaxUnderstand how to make decisions in codeLearn how to use a State Machine to control and organize a Unity projectMaster the Scripting Reference to bring GameObjects to lifeLearn how to use the Unity Physics engine for moving and detecting GameObject collisions and triggersDisplay information on the game screen","publisher":"Sarah Sollars","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TCznnQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":null,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TCznnQEACAAJ&dq=c%23,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=230&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781430201670","title":"Beginning Visual C# 2005 Express Edition: From Novice to Professional","author":"Heather Wright","publish_date":"2006-11-17","description":"* Written by Peter Wright, who taught 100,000 new programmers how to program in Visual Basic when Microsoft last launched a new product so suitable for new/hobbyist and aspirant programmers.

Almost everything has changed, from data access, to remote object calls, to the deployment of software components. And of course, .NET introduces a new technology in XML Web services that may revolutionize Web development. Distributed .NET Programming in C# describes how to use these new .NET technologies to build fast, scalable, and robust distributed applications. Along the way, it answers common questions such as, How do I use the .NET Remoting Framework? What role does COM+ play in the .NET universe? How can I interoperate with COM components? What's the difference between .NET Remoting and Web services? How will these changes affect the architecture and design of a distributed application? Author Tom Barnaby assumes the reader is already familiar with the fundamentals of .NET. However, a .NET overview is provided to concisely explain several of the core .NET technologies that are essential for distributed programming, including building, versioning, and deploying assemblies; garbage collection; serialization; and attribute-based programming.","publisher":"Apress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QuclhCuwBc0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":528,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QuclhCuwBc0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=c%23,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=246&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780735618152","title":"Microsoft ASP.Net Programming with Microsoft Visual C# .Net","author":"G.

H. Chaudhary.","publish_date":"2014-06-02","description":"This book gives a good start and complete introduction for C# Programming for Beginner’s. While reading this book it is fun and easy to read it. This book is best suitable for first time C# readers, Covers all fast track topics of C# for all Computer Science students and Professionals. This book is targeted toward those who have little or no programming experience or who might be picking up C# as a second language. The book has been structured and written with a purpose: to get you productive as quickly as possible. I’ve used my experiences in writing applications with C# and teaching C# to create a book that I hope cuts through the fluff and teaches you what you need to know. All too often, authors fall into the trap of focusing on the technology rather than on the practical application of the technology. I’ve worked hard to keep this book focused on teaching you practical skills that you can apply immediately toward a development project. This book is divided into ten Chapters, each of which focuses on a different aspect of developing applications with C#. These parts generally follow the flow of tasks you’ll perform as you begin creating your own programs with C#. I recommend that you read them in the order in which they appear. Using C#, this book develops the concepts and theory of Building the Program Logic and Interfaces analysis, Exceptions, Delegates and Events and other important things in a gradual, step-by-step manner, proceeding from concrete examples to abstract principles. Standish covers a wide range of both traditional and contemporary software engineering topics. This is a handy guide of sorts for any computer science engineering Students, Thinking In C# Programming is a solution bank for various complex problems related to C# and .NET. It can be used as a reference manual by Computer Science Engineering students. This Book also covers all aspects of B.TECH CS, IT, and BCA and MCA, BSC IT. Preview introduced programmers to a new era called functional programming. C# focused on bridging the gap between programming languages and databases. This book covers all the language features from the first version through C# . It also provides you with the essentials of using Visual Studio 2005 to let you enjoy its capabilities and save you time by using features such as IntelliSense. Learning a new programming language can be intimidating. If you’ve never programmed before, the act of typing seemingly cryptic text to produce sleek and powerful applications probably seems like a black art, and you might wonder how you’ll ever learn everything you need to know. The answer is, of course, one step at a time. The first step to learning a language is the same as that of any other activity: building confidence. Programming is part art and part science. Although it might seem like magic, it’s more akin to illusion: After you know how things work a lot of the mysticism goes away, freeing you to focus on the mechanics necessary to produce any given desired result.

Fokker, Mark H. Overmars","publish_date":"2015-07-14","description":"C# is the language of choice for learning how to program. It is a very well structured object-oriented language and avoids some of the problems of Java. An excellent free programming environment is available for C#, as well as a game programming framework. And (if necessary) moving from C# to C++ is easy. Developing computer games is a perfect way to learn how to program in modern programming languages. This book teaches how to program in C# through the creation of computer games – and without requiring any previous programming experience. Contrary to most programming books, Egges, Fokker and Overmars do not organize the presentation according to programming language constructs, but instead use the structure and elements of computer games as a framework. For instance, there are chapters on dealing with player input, game objects, game worlds, game states, levels, animation, physics, and intelligence. The reader will be guided through the development of four games showing the various aspects of game development. Starting with a simple shooting game, the authors move on to puzzle games consisting of multiple levels, and conclude the book by developing a full-fledged platform game with animation, game physics, and intelligent enemies. They show a number of commonly used techniques in games, such as drawing layers of sprites, rotating, scaling and animating sprites, showing a heads-up display, dealing with physics, handling interaction between game objects, and creating pleasing visual effects such as snow or glitter. At the same time, they provide a thorough introduction to C# and object-oriented programming, introducing step by step important aspects of programming in general, including many programming constructs and idioms, syntax diagrams, collections, and exception handling. The book is also designed to be used as a basis for a game-oriented programming course. For each part, there are concluding exercises and challenges, which are generally more complex programming endeavors. Lots of supplementary materials for organizing such a course are available on the accompanying web site http://www.csharpprogramminggames.com, including installation instructions, solutions to the exercises, software installation instructions, game sprites and sounds.","publisher":"Springer","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AqMeswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":443,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AqMeswEACAAJ&dq=c%23,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=281&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780735666627","title":"Start Here!

Most scripts function within the game framework or in your own structures. The techniques and concepts discussed in the book give you a solid foundation in game development. The first ten chapters set up the flexible, reusable framework based in C# and suitable for all game types. The book also explains scripting of generic, reusable, and common functionality. The remainder of the text adds game-specific code to the framework to create four example games: a top-down arena shooter, a futuristic racing combat game, a tank arena deathmatch game, and a classic arcade-style vertical scrolling shoot ’em up. The games encompass artificial intelligence (path following, target chasing, and line-of-sight patrolling behaviors), game state control, wheel colliders, and weapon inventory management. The example files are available for download on the book’s CRC Press web page. Reducing your recoding, repurposing, or adaptation time, this book provides script-based components that you can use to jump start your own projects.

This exciting new approach to developing ASP.NET web applications has taken the development world by storm over the last few years. Now a mature technology suitable for mainstream use, its adoption has exploded in recent times. Until recently, ASP.NET MVC was regarded as an advanced technology only suitable for experienced developers with a strong knowledge of classic ASP.NET and C# coding behind them. This book overturns that prejudice and shows that the beautiful simplicity of ASP.NET MVC is just as suitable for novice developers venturing into real-world application design for the first time. With the aid of a fully worked demo application this book explains and demonstrates for you the three pillars of MVC in action. You’ll see howthe Model, View and Controller patterns work together in a compliementary manner to provide MVC’s powerful results. There’s never been a better time to learn how to use ASP.NETMVC 4. The technology will speed your development times, reduce the verbosity of your code and simplify your application designs all at once. Take the first step towards ASP.NET MVC mastery with Beginning ASP.NET MVC 4. What you’ll learn How to get started with ASP.NET MVC. What tools and components you’ll need and how to download and set up the demo application on your system. Understand the details of the MVC pattern with deep-dives into each of the Model, View and Controller elements supported by working code showing them in action. How to apply and extend the MVC patterns to real world solutions: adding AJAX and jQuery, validation and securing user data, testing and deploying the finished application. All of these are discussed and demonstrated. Who this book is for This book is written for readers with basic ASP.NET expertise, such as you might gain from reading Beginning ASP.NET 4.5 in C#. You should be familiar with the underlying structure of ASP.NET applications and comfortable following examples that are underpinned with straight-forward C# code. If you've just found your feet with ASP.NET and are looking to take the next step on the road to mastery then this is the book for you.

JavaScript is in the top ten most-used programming languages world wide, and is the basis for applications that can run in any modern browser, on any device from smart phone to tablet to PC. Especial emphasis is given to touch-based interface, but all games also run using a regular mouse and keyboard setup. The four games you’ll develop from reading this book are: Painter Jewel Jam Penguin Pairs Tick Tick These four games are casual, arcade-style games representing the aim-and-shoot, puzzle, maze, and platform styles of game play. The approach in Building JavaScript Games follows the basic structure of a game rather than the syntax of a language. From almost the very first chapter you are building games to run on your phone or other device and show to your friends. Successive projects teach about handling player input, manipulating game objects, designing game worlds, managing levels, and realism through physics. All told, you’ll develop four well-designed games, making Building JavaScript Games one of the most enjoyable ways there is to learn about programming browser-based games. The final chapters in the book contain a very nice bonus of sorts. In them you will find excerpts from interviews with two prominent people from the game industry: Mark Overmars, who is CTO of Tingly Games and creator of GameMaker, and Peter Vesterbacka, the CMO of Rovio Entertainment - the creators of the Angry Birds franchise. Their insight and perspective round off what is already a fun and valuable book. What you’ll learn Create games to run on phones and tablets Manage sprites and other game objects React to player input through touch and button presses Allow game players to progress through different levels Achieve realistic movement through applied physics Prepare your games properly for commercial deployment Who this book is for Building JavaScript Games is for technology enthusiasts interested in learning about programming, and especially about game programming on their mobile devices. The book is also ideal for programmers in other languages wanting to make the move to mobile development using the cross-platform environment of JavaScript and HTML5. If you’re interested in browser-based development, especially the development of mobile games, then Building JavaScript Games is the perfect choice.
