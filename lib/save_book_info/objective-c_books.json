Even though Apple created iPhone as a closed device, tens of thousands of developers bought them with the express purpose of designing and running third-party software. In this clear and concise book, veteran hacker Jonathan Zdziarski -- one of the original hackers of the iPhone -- explains the iPhone's native environment and how you can build software for this device using its Objective-C, C, and C++ development frameworks. iPhone Open Application Development walks you through the iPhone's native development environment, offers an overview of the Objective-C language you'll use with it, and supplies background for the iPhone operating system. You also get detailed recipes and working examples for everyone's favorite iPhone features -- graphics and audio programming, interfaces for adding multitouch functionality to games, the use of hardware sensors, and the device's vast user interface kit. This book explains: How to access the iPhone's underlying operating system The makeup of an iPhone application How to get the open source tool chain running on your desktop The iPhone's core user interface framework, which is heavily tied to major application-level functions Using the many touted iPhone features such as multitouch, hardware sensors, and gestures Intercepting and handling event notifications for many iPhone-related events Raw video surfaces and 3D transformations that take you deeper into advanced graphics on the iPhone How to record and play simple sounds and intercept sound events Advanced digital audio output using Apple's new Audio Toolbox framework Advanced user interface components such as section lists, keyboards, and image manipulation The Appendix includes a compendium of miscellaneous code examples for cool application features, such as using the camera and creating a CoverFlow®-like album browser. This book is a true hacker's book, designed for the millions of users who have run third party applications on their iPhone, but its concepts and code examples have shown to be remarkably similar to Apple's official SDK, making this book a valuable resource for both camps. Any programmer can use this book to write applications with the same spectacular effects that made the device an immediate hit, and impress users just as much as the official iPhone software does. That programmer can easily be you.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Sk5V6jqk8sQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":288,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Sk5V6jqk8sQC&dq=objective-c,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":4.5,"ratings_count":4,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Sk5V6jqk8sQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=objective-c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=39&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781118582411","title":"Professional Objective-C","author":"Michael Dippery","publish_date":"2015-04-13","description":"The comprehensive Objective-C reference every Mac and iOS developer needs Objective-C is central to both iOS and Mac OS development, and as the demand for iPhone and iPad apps continues to grow, so does interest in Objective-C.

Die Autoren legen hierbei besonderen Wert auf eine strukturierte Einführung. Das Buch besteht aus zwei Teilen: Teil I behandelt alle grundlegenden Sprachelemente von Objective-C wie die objektorientierte Programmierung, Kategorien, Properties, Protokolle, die Ausnahmebehandlung und Blöcke. In Teil II des Buches zeigen die Autoren, wie Objective-C unter Mac OS X und iOS eingesetzt werden kann. Sie behandeln die dort vorhandenen Entwicklungswerkzeuge und mitgelieferten Frameworks, insbesondere das Foundation Framework. Ein ausführliches Kapitel beschäftigt sich mit Design Patterns für Objective-C und erläutert fünf Patterns für die praktische Arbeit mit dem Cocoa-Framework. Zahlreiche Praxisbeispiele verdeutlichen den konkreten Einsatz von Objective-C. Zusätzlich finden Sie in jedem Kapitel Übungsaufgaben mit Musterlösungen. Die Autoren stellen die Programmiersprache Objective-C 2.0 in den Mittelpunkt und gehen dabei von grundlegenden Programmierkenntnissen aus. Alle, die noch keine Kenntnisse in C besitzen, finden im Anhang einen kurzen C-Kurs, der zum Verständnis von Objective-C ausreicht. Erfahrungen mit objektorientierter Programmierung werden nicht benötigt, die Konzepte werden von Grund auf erläutert. Alle Beispiele im Buch basieren auf der Version Mac OS X 10.8 und sind für Versionen ab 10.6 ausgelegt. Für die Leser, die noch unter Mac OS X 10.6 programmieren, sind die Features der Sprache und des Cocoa-Frameworks gekennzeichnet, die hier nicht oder nur eingeschränkt zur Verfügung stehen. Alle restlichen Teile sind auch für den Einsatz unter Mac OS X 10.6 geeignet. Die Erläuterungen zum iPhone basieren auf iOS ab der Version 6.

Apple eskiden sadece belli bir kitleye hitap ettiğinden, Apple platformları için uygulama geliştiren yazılımcı sayısı da diğer programlama dillerini kullananlara nazaran daha azdı. iPhone devrimiyle birlikte Apple kendi yazılım geliştirme ortamını dış dünyadaki geliştiricilerin kullanımına açtı ve yazılım geliştiricilere önemli bir iş kapısı araladı. Böylece itibaren Apple platformları için uygulama geliştirmede kullanılan Objective-C dilinin popüleritesi inanılmaz bir şekilde artmaya başladı. Programlama dillerinin popülerliğini araştıran Tiobe Software isimli bağımsız bir firmanın değerlendirmesine göre, Objective-C programlama dili 2006 yılında popülerlik konusunda 38. sıradayken Şubat 2012 itibariyle PHP’yi arkasına alıp 5. sıraya yerleşmiş durumdadır. 2012 senesi içerisinde yaygınlık açısından C++ ve C#’ı geçmesi, Java ve C’nin arkasından 3. sıraya yerleşmesi beklenmektedir. Kullanımı bu kadar hızlı bir artış gösteren ve iOS platformunun gücünün perde arkasındaki aktörü olan Objective-C diline başlarken; kaynak sıkıntısı çeken geliştiricilerin referans kaynak ihtiyacına cevap vermek, bu kitabın temel amacıdır. Bu kitap, şimdiye kadar karşılaştıklarınızdan çok farklı bir dünyaya giriş yapmanızı sağlayacak. Eğer programlama deneyiminiz varsa ve MAC platformuna yeni başlıyorsanız, şu ana kadar karşılaştıklarınızdan tamamen farklı olan bir platforma adım atacağınızın bilincinde olmalısınız. Burası tamamen farklı bir bakış açısıyla tasarlanmış, özgün ve şahsi kanaatimce çok başarılı tasarlanmış bir dünyadır. Eğer hiçbir programlama deneyiminiz yoksa ve bu platforma ilk defa adım atıyorsanız, bundan sonra karşılaşacaklarınızın yavan kalmasını sağlayacak kadar başarılı bir deneyim olacaktır. Bu kitabın amacı; iOS platformundan ziyade Objective-C dilinin temellerini vermektir. Dolayısıyla kitap içerisinde Objective-C’nin miras aldığı C programlama dili ve Objective-C programlama dili konusunda komut satırı tabanlı uygulamalar bulacaksınız. Bu uygulamalara ek olarak gelen DVD içerisinde, iOS uygulama geliştirme konusunda birkaç örnek uygulamanın nasıl geliştirileceğini anlatan çeşitli videolar bulacaksınız. Bu videoların yanı sıra, XCode geliştirme ortamının kurulumu ve kullanımı hakkında ayrıntılı bilgiler ve canlı anlatımlar içeren ve Objective-C uygulamalarının diğer ortamlarda nasıl derlenip çalıştırılacağınız anlatan videolar da olacaktır. Kitapta yer alan başlıca konu başlıkları şunlardır: • iOS İşletim Sistemi Katmanları • iOS Yazılım Geliştirme Kiti Araçları • iOS SDK ve Geliştirme Ortamlarının Kurumları • XCode IDE • iOS Simulator • Interface Builder • Instruments • Cocoa Touch Katmanı • Apple LLVM Derleyici • Objective-C Programlama Diline Giriş • Nesne Yönelimli Programlama • Objective-C Dilinin Diğer Programlama Dilleriyle Karşılaştırılması • Derleme ve Bağlama İşlemleri • Temel C Programlama Kavramları • Veri Tipleri • Özel Değişken Tipleri • Temel Girdi ve Çıktı Komutları • Tip Dönüşümleri ve Çevrimleri • Fonksiyonlar • Main Fonksiyon • İşaretçiler • Dinamik Bellek Yönetimi • Direktifler • SmallTalk • NSLog • NSString • Sınıflar, Nesneler ve Kalıtım Kavramları • Sarmallama Kavramı ve Özellik Kullanımı • Çok Biçimlilik, Dinamik Bağlama, Hata Yönetimi ve Protokol Kavramı • Kategoriler ve Bloklar • Koleksiyonlar • Foundation Sınıfları ve Dosya İşlemleri • IBOutlet ve IBAction • Storyboard Kullanımı • Film Kataloğu Uygulaması • Uygulamalı Eğitim Videoları","publisher":"KODLAB YAYIN DAĞITIM YAZILIM LTD.ŞTİ.","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_xXmBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":808,"written_language":"tr","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_xXmBwAAQBAJ&dq=objective-c,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_xXmBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=objective-c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=86&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781430246633","title":"Learn Lua for iOS Game Development","author":"Jayant Varma","publish_date":"2013-04-01","description":"So you have a great game idea for iPhone or iPad, but Objective-C just seems a bit daunting.

Are you an experienced C#/.NET developer who wants to reach the huge iPhone/iPad market? Now, you can create great iOS apps without first mastering Objective-C and Apple’s development toolset. With MonoTouch, you can leverage the skills you already have to create powerful apps that can be sold in Apple’s App Store or deployed throughout your organization. In Learning MonoTouch, Michael Bluestein helps you get started with MonoTouch fast and make the most of its remarkably robust capabilities. The book first walks you through setting up your MonoTouch development environment, explaining how MonoTouch abstracts the iOS SDK to permit development against native iOS classes from C#.

Moraco","publish_date":"2012-10-10","description":"The advent of iOS 5 and the newest Xcode has unveiled an innovative, design-centric set of tools called Storyboarding, for you to more easily conceptualize and design your app from top to bottom. A time saver for sure, but it's new! Dr. Rory Lewis, Yulia McCarthy and Stephen Moraco — a best selling Apress author, a former Apple iOS engineering group intern and a successful app developer — have teamed up to bring you this book, Beginning iOS Storyboarding. The three authors have found a beautiful way to lead the beginner into Storyboarding and at the same time show old school coders of Objective-C the new and exquisite methodology of this incredible tool. For the beginner who has never programmed, Beginning iOS Storyboarding shows how to extract those cool and innovative app ideas you have in your head into a working app ready for sale on the iTunes store by using Apple's new technology that allows you to skip chunks of code by just dragging scenes and segues onto your Storyboard canvas. Even if you're an intermediate or pro-level Objective-C developer, you can still learn the ins and outs of Xcode's new Storyboarding feature, and find new ways of building and debugging your new Storyboarding app. Yup: This book is also for you, too. In this book, you get the following, beyond learning the fundamentals and classical elements of Storyboarding: Design and build utilities and a location based service app using Storyboarding techniques Design and build a universal app with a rich user interface and user experience (UX) Create a fun game app, and more What you’ll learn How iOS Storyboarding is like a different planet in the Xcode universe. We do this by introducing you to the standard transitions to views, passing data to the views, returning data from the views, and, lastly, showing how to navigate the critical transitions to views. How to develop a simple utility app using Storyboarding. Here we learn the foundation of many apps, which is how to place controls on the settings screen of a utility application and to return those settings to the main view of the app via the settings view delegate protocol. How to develop an app with an advanced MKMapView. Specifically, we introduce you to override the default views provided by Apple’s initial project templates. This opens the door to you being able to code specialized views such as MKMapView, and utilize iOS Location Services for building navigation-based apps. What are the cool, powerful tools that enable you to create page controller view transitions. We dig deep into the ins and outs of how to apply the UIPageControls to display views and supply traditional view notification to controlled views. How to create a very cool universal app while you learn how to develop table views, which in the iPad case, present themselves differently depending upon the device orientation using the UISplitViewController. How to build a universal app with two Storyboards (one for iPhone, one for iPad) and provide techniques and tips for developing universal apps. How to build a tabbed app that stores and manages user documents in the iCloud. How to develop a cool game app which stretches your knowledge of how segues can be used to provide much more complex navigation paths between screens and devices, as well as accessibility with Apple’s iOS Game Center. Who this book is for This book is for the beginner who has never programmed, but can use the Storyboarding tool in Xcode to get up and running fast. This book is also for experienced iOS developers who wish to learn Storyboarding to quickly cut down on their app development and debugging time.

Typical examples include iPhone applications, computer aided design – both electrical and mechanical, biochemistry applications, and incremental compilers. Serialization, which is sometimes used in such situations is notoriously tedious and error prone. In this book, Jiri Soukup and Petr Macháček show in detail how to write programs which store their internal data automatically and transparently to disk. Together with special data structure libraries which treat relations among objects as first-class entities, and with a UML class-diagram generator, the core application code is much simplified. The benchmark chapter shows a typical example where persistent data is faster by the order of magnitude than with a traditional database, in both traversing and accessing the data. The authors explore and exploit advanced features of object-oriented languages in a depth hardly seen in print before. Yet, you as a reader need only a basic knowledge of C++, Java, C#, or Objective C. These languages are quite similar with respect to persistency, and the authors explain their differences where necessary. The book targets professional programmers working on any industry applications, it teaches you how to design your own persistent data or how to use the existing packages efficiently. Researchers in areas like language design, compiler construction, performance evaluation, and no-SQL applications will find a wealth of novel ideas and valuable implementation tips.

It is called a macro processor because it allows you to define macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs. The C preprocessor is intended to be used only with C, C++, and Objective-C source code. In the past, it has been abused as a general text processor. It will choke on input which does not obey C's lexical rules. For example, apostrophes will be interpreted as the beginning of character constants, and cause errors. Also, you cannot rely on it preserving characteristics of the input which are not significant to C-family languages.

Excerpt: Steven Paul \"Steve\" Jobs (born February 24, 1955) is an American business magnate and inventor. He is the co-founder and chief executive officer of Apple Inc. Jobs also previously served as chief executive of Pixar Animation Studios; he became a member of the board of directors of The Walt Disney Company in 2006, following the acquisition of Pixar by Disney. He was credited in the 1995 movie Toy Story as an executive producer. In the late 1970s, Jobs, with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Mike Markkula, and others, designed, developed, and marketed one of the first commercially successful lines of personal computers, the Apple II series. In the early 1980s, Jobs was among the first to see the commercial potential of the mouse-driven graphical user interface which led to the creation of the Macintosh. After losing a power struggle with the board of directors in 1984, Jobs resigned from Apple and founded NeXT, a computer platform development company specializing in the higher education and business markets. Apple's subsequent 1996 buyout of NeXT brought Jobs back to the company he co-founded, and he has served as its CEO since 1997. In 1986, he acquired the computer graphics division of Lucasfilm Ltd which was spun off as Pixar Animation Studios. He remained CEO and majority shareholder at 50.1% until its acquisition by The Walt Disney company in 2006...","publisher":"Books LLC, Wiki Series","image_url":null,"total_pages":166,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L4crSgAACAAJ&dq=objective-c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=177&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781119009313","title":"Beginning Swift Programming","author":"Wei-Meng Lee","publish_date":"2014-12-22","description":"A beginner's guide to constructing dynamic Mac and iPhone apps using Swift covers such topics as data types, strings and characters, class inheritance, protocols and delegates, and closures, with code examples and exercises to build skills.","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=j86SBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":288,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j86SBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=objective-c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=178&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781849690355","title":"Iphone Applications Tune-Up","author":"Loyal Moses","publish_date":"2011-10-11","description":"Written to be read straight through as well as to be used as a technical reference, each chapter of this book focuses on an individual aspect of application performance and how it relates to the overall development and tune-up process.

And since GDB can be ported to Windows, Microsoft developers and others who use this platform can also take advantage of this amazing free software that allows you to see exactly what's going on inside of a program as it's executing. This new pocket guide gives you a convenient quick reference for using the debugger with several different programming languages, including C, C++, Java, Fortran and Assembly.The GNU debugger is the most useful tool during the testing phase of the software development cycle because it helps you catch bugs in the act. You can see what a program was doing at the moment it crashed, and then readily pinpoint and correct problem code. With the GDB Pocket Reference on hand, the process is quick and painless. The book covers the essentials of using GBD is a testing environment, including how to specify a target for debugging and how to make a program stop on specified conditions.This handy guide also provides details on using the debugger to examine the stack, source files and data to find the cause of program failure-and then explains ways to use GBD to make quick changes to the program for further testing and debugging.The ability to spot a bug in real time with GDB can save you hours of frustration, and having a quick way to refer to GBD's essential functions is key to making the process work.

Apple se preocupó en disminuir la resistencia a la adopción de Swift por los programadores expertos. Para eso, permitió que el nuevo lenguaje utilizara el mismo compilador y pudiera convivir con Objective-C en la misma aplicación. De esa forma, nadie será forzado a aprenderla inmediatamente, ya que es posible continuar programando de la manera tradicional y adoptar la nueva tecnología a los pocos. Pero seguro que ahora nos preguntamos, ¿No era el Objective-C suficientemente bueno? No hay dudas que ese lenguaje es muy poderoso y sirvió a Apple de forma incuestionable durante todos esos años. Sin embargo no es fácil de aprender. El hecho de haber sido construida en base a los lenguajes tradicionales como C creó amarres de compatibilidad que dificultan aún más la comprensión del lenguaje, principalmente para los nuevos programadores.

The workshop was designed to bring together two developing communities: the multi-agent systems researchers who were the core participants at Agents World, and social scientists interested in using MAS as a research tool. Most of the social sciences were represented, with contributions touching on sociology, management science, economics, psychology, environmental science, ecology, and linguistics. The workshop was organised in association with SimSoc, an informal group of social scientists who have arranged an irregular series of influential workshops on using simulation in the social sciences beginning in 1992. While the papers were quite heterogeneous in substantive domain and in their disciplinary origins, there were several themes which recurred during the workshop. One of these was considered in more depth in a round table discussion led by Jim Doran at the end of the workshop on 'Representing cognition for social simulation', which addressed the issue of whether and how cognition should be modelled. Quite divergent views were expressed, with some participants denying that individual cognition needed to be modelled at all, and others arguing that cognition must be at the centre of social simulation.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=W-eR6Xn5EHIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":236,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W-eR6Xn5EHIC&pg=PA79&dq=objective-c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=194&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780133961317","title":"Swift for Beginners: Develop and Design","author":"Boisy G.

Want to learn more? Whether you’re a self-taught iPhone development genius or have just made your way through the pages of Beginning iPhone 3 Development, we have the perfect book for you. More iPhone 3 Development: Tackling iPhone SDK 3 digs deeper into Apple’s latest SDK. Best-selling authors Dave Mark and Jeff LaMarche explain concepts as only they can, covering topics like Core Data, peer-to-peer networking using GameKit and network streams, working with data from the web, MapKit, in-application e-mail, and more. All the concepts and APIs are clearly presented with code snippets you can customize and use, as you like, in your own apps. If you are going to write a professional iPhone app, you’ll want to get your arms around Core Data, and there’s no better place to do so than in the pages of this book. The book continues right where Beginning iPhone 3 Development left off with a series of chapters devoted to Core Data, the standard for persistence that Apple introduced to iPhone with SDK 3. Jeff and Dave carefully step through each of the Core Data concepts and show you techniques and tips specifically for writing larger applications—offering a breadth of coverage you won't find anywhere else. The Core Data coverage alone is worth the price of admission. But there's so much more. This book covers a variety of networking mechanisms, from GameKit’s relatively simple BlueTooth peer-to-peer model, to the addition of Bonjour discovery and network streams, through the complexity of accessing files via the web. Dave and Jeff will also take you through coverage of concurrent programming and some advanced techniques for debugging your applications. Whether you are a relative newcomer to iPhone development or an old hand looking to expand your horizons, there’s something for everyone in More iPhone 3 Development. Note: A few of the apps in this book demonstrate technologies not yet supported by the simulator. To run them on your iPhone or iPod touch, you'll need to join one of Apple's paid iPhone developer programs.","publisher":"Apress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F5jrMwxw8mAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":552,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F5jrMwxw8mAC&dq=objective-c,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F5jrMwxw8mAC&pg=PA173&dq=objective-c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=198&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781430227311","title":"Enterprise Mac Security: Mac OS X Snow Leopard","author":"Charles Edge, William Barker, Beau Hunter, Gene Sullivan, Ken Barker","publish_date":"2010-12-31","description":"A common misconception in the Mac community is that Mac’s operating system is more secure than others.

Welch","publish_date":"2004","description":"Communicating Process Architecture (CPA) describes an approach to system development that is process-oriented. It makes no great distinction between hardware and software. It has a major root in the theory of Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP). However, the underlying theory is not limited to CSP. The importance of mobility of both channel and process within a network sees integration with ideas from the ð-calculus. Other formalisms are also exploited, such as BSP and MPI. The focus is on sound methods for the engineering of significant concurrent systems, including those that are distributed (across the Internet or within a single chip) and / or software-scheduled on a single execution unit. Traditionally, at CPA, the emphasis has been on theory and practice - developing and applying tools based upon CSP and related theories to build high-integrity systems of significant size. In particular, interest focuses on achieving scalability and security against error. The development of Java, C, and C++, libraries to facilitate secure concurrent programming using 'mainstream' languages has allowed CPA to continue and proliferate. This work continues in support of the engineering of distributed applications. Recently, there has been greater reference to theory and its more direct application to programming systems and languages. In this volume the formal CSP is very well presented. The papers provide a healthy mixture of the academic and commercial, software and hardware, application and infrastructure, which reflects the nature of the discipline.","publisher":null,"image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kpBQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":417,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kpBQAAAAMAAJ&q=objective-c,+subject:computers&dq=objective-c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=209&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"NeXT development tools","author":"NeXT Computer, Inc","publish_date":"1991","description":"An essential resource describing the tools available for use when developing a NeXT application.

Hoy en día, es utilizado principalmente en el Mac OS X, que es un entorno basado en el OpenStep y es el principal lenguaje utilizado en las aplicaciones estructuradas NeXTSTEP, OPENSTE y Cocoa. Los programas genéricos en Objetive-C que no hacen uso de estas bibliotecas también pueden ser compilados por cualquier sistema soportado por gcc, que incluye un compilador Objective-C. La Sintaxis de Objective-C es una capa muy fina construida sobre el lenguaje de programación C y que constituye un superconjunto estricto de C. O sea, es posible compilar cualquier programa desarrollado en C con un compilador Objective-C. Objective-C deriva su lenguaje tanto del C como del SmallTalk. La mayor parte de la sintaxis fue heredada del lenguaje de programación C, mientras que la sintaxis para los aspectos orientados a objetos fueron creados para habilitar el paso de mensajes en el estilo SmallTalk. Toda la programación se realiza en el SDK de Objective-C. Objective-C también es un superconjunto de C, lo que le permite escribir código en el lenguaje C tradicional. Objetive-C incorpora poderosas capacidades de orientación a objetos. Debido a su origen fuera de la norma de C, Objective-C puede parecer un poco extraño a primera vista, pero una vez que haya trabajado con él, verá que es elegante y fácil de leer, proporcionando numerosas mejoras al tradicional código ANSI C.","publisher":"IT Campus Academy","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZujLCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":308,"written_language":"es","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZujLCgAAQBAJ&dq=objective-c,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZujLCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=objective-c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=212&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9788441530393","title":"Programacion con Objective-C","author":"Stephen G.

Technically speaking, this rapid development also create many opportunities and challenges for both industrialists and academics, as the design requirements and constraints have completely changed in this global design and manufacture environment. Consequently the way to design, manufacture and realise products have changed as well. The days of designing for a local market and using local suppliers in manufacturing have gone, if enterprises aim to maintain their competitiveness and global expansion leading to further success. In this global context and scenario, both industry and the academia have an urgent need to equip themselves with the latest knowledge, technology and methods developed for engineering design and manufacture.

Self-organizing maps form a branch of unsupervised learning, which is the study of what can be determined about the statistical properties of input data without explicit feedback from a teacher. The articles are drawn from the journal Neural Computation.The book consists of five sections. The first section looks at attempts to model the organization of cortical maps and at the theory and applications of the related artificial neural network algorithms. The second section analyzes topographic maps and their formation via objective functions. The third section discusses cortical maps of stimulus features. The fourth section discusses self-organizing maps for unsupervised data analysis. The fifth section discusses extensions of self-organizing maps, including two surprising applications of mapping algorithms to standard computer science problems: combinatorial optimization and sorting.Contributors J.

Although Cocoa is indeed huge, once you understand the object-oriented patterns it uses, you’ll find it remarkably elegant, consistent, and simple. Cocoa Design Patterns begins with the mother of all patterns: the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, which is central to all Mac and iPhone development. Encouraged, and in some cases enforced by Apple’s tools, it’s important to have a firm grasp of MVC right from the start. The book’s midsection is a catalog of the essential design patterns you’ll encounter in Cocoa, including Fundamental patterns, such as enumerators, accessors, and two-stage creation Patterns that empower, such as singleton, delegates, and the responder chain Patterns that hide complexity, including bundles, class clusters, proxies and forwarding, and controllers And that’s not all of them! Cocoa Design Patterns painstakingly isolates 28 design patterns, accompanied with real-world examples and sample code you can apply to your applications today. The book wraps up with coverage of Core Data models, AppKit views, and a chapter on Bindings and Controllers.

Springing from the original Vermont Recipes Web site, where many of today’s Cocoa developers got their start, Cocoa Recipes for Mac OS X, Second Edition is a programming cookbook that shows you how to create a complete Mac OS X application. In this updated edition, author Bill Cheeseman employs a practical, step-by-step method for building a program from start to finish using the Cocoa frameworks. He begins by creating the project using Xcode and designing and building the user interface with Interface Builder, and then he fills in the details expected of any working application, such as managing documents and windows, setting up the main menu, and configuring controls. Later recipes show you how to add important features such as a preferences window, printing, a Help book, and AppleScript support. The book concludes with a discussion of deployment of your finished product and steps you can take to explore additional features. Equipped with the expertise and real-world techniques in this book, programmers with some knowledge of C and Objective-C can quickly master the craft of writing Cocoa programs for Mac OS X. Written for C and Objective-C programmers who want to tap the extraordinary power and flexibility designed into the Cocoa frameworks, as well as for experienced Cocoa developers looking to extend their skills.

Their interests do not always coincide and are at times even completely opposed. Competition or partial cooperation among decision makers should be considered as an essen tial part of the problem when we deal with the decision making problems in organizations which consist of decision makers with conflicting interests. Game theory has been dealing with such problems and its techniques have been used as powerful analytical tools in the resolution process of the decision problems. The publication of the great work by J. von Neumann and O. Morgen stern in 1944 attracted attention of many people and laid the foundation of game theory. We can see remarkable advances in the field of game theory for analysis of economic situations and a number of books in the field have been published in recent years. The aim of game theory is to specify the behavior of each player so as to optimize the interests of the player. It then recommends a set of solutions as strategies so that the actions chosen by each decision maker (player) lead to an outcome most profitable for himself or her self.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QTg9oTeTTwEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":258,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QTg9oTeTTwEC&pg=PA235&dq=objective-c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=241&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9788436954609","title":"Programación de aplicaciones para Iphone y Ipad","author":"Honrubia López, Francisco Javier","publish_date":"2013","description":"El curso de programación de aplicaciones para iPhone y iPad está dirigido a aquellas personas interesadas en aprender a programar para dispositivos iOS utilizando las herramientas estándar de programación de Apple para implementar sus propias aplicaciones móviles en dichos sistemas.

You'll learn the essentials of creating great apps, and by the end of this book, you'll have built a fully functional API-driven app. Whether you're a newcomer looking for an alternative to Objective-C or a hardened Rails veteran, RubyMotion allows you to create gorgeous apps with no compromise in performance or developer happiness. Developers interested in native iOS app development have been restricted to the limits of Objective-C and Xcode--until RubyMotion came along. RubyMotion enables you do full iOS development using Ruby. You have access to familiar tools such as Rake and RubyGems and can compile Ruby code into native applications. RubyMotion even comes with a Ruby console useful for live coding and interactive debugging. And since RubyMotion is built on top of the Objective-C runtime, you can use all of Apple's libraries and most third-party code alongside Ruby classes. This book takes you from zero knowledge of iOS development to building an app that displays information about colors using a web service API. You'll work through each topic with a small example app that covers just enough to get you familiar with the techniques you need to get real work done. You'll start with just drawing boxes on the screen, but you'll quickly add animations, a navigation stack, and high-performance table views. You'll peek into less visible components, such as using Ruby metaprogramming to create JSON-based models. You'll use some incredibly useful common Ruby techniques that are only possible in RubyMotion, such as writing automated unit tests with an RSpec-like framework. Using both Apple's existing libraries and fresh, community-driven RubyMotion projects, you'll be well on your way to writing real-world apps. What You Need: A Macintosh running OS X 10.7 or later is required to install RubyMotion. RubyMotion is a commercial product and currently requires a purchased license. Experience with the Ruby language and Ruby tools like RubyGems and Rake are suggested.","publisher":"Pragmatic Bookshelf","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5OpqngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":91,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5OpqngEACAAJ&dq=objective-c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=255&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781849513968","title":"Appcelerator Titanium Smartphone App Development Cookbook","author":"Boydlee Pollentine","publish_date":"2011","description":"Written in a cookbook style, this book offers solutions using a recipe-based approach.

The gr- ing perception of the ‘Hardware becoming Soft’ and ‘Software becoming Hard’ with the emergence of the FPGAs has made its impact on both the hardware and software professionals to change their mindset of working in narrow domains. An interdisciplinary field where ‘Hardware meets the Software’ for undertaking se- ingly unfeasible tasks is System on Chip (SoC) which has become the basic pl- form of modern electronic appliances. If it wasn’t for SoCs, we wouldn’t be driving our car with foresight of the traffic congestion before hand using GPS. Without the omnipresence of the SoCs in our every walks of life, the society is wouldn’t have evidenced the rich benefits of the convergence of the technologies such as audio, video, mobile, IPTV just to name a few. The growing expectations of the consumers have placed the field of SoC design at the heart of at variance trends. On one hand there are challenges owing to design complexities with the emergence of the new processors, RTOS, software protocol stacks, buses, while the brutal forces of deep submicron effects such as crosstalk, electromigration, timing closures are challe- ing the design metrics.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=74szgruGW3EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":174,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=74szgruGW3EC&dq=objective-c,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=74szgruGW3EC&pg=PA123&dq=objective-c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=262&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9783319095844","title":"Learning and Intelligent Optimization: 8th International Conference, Lion 8, Gainesville, FL, USA, February 16-21, 2014.

Jayaswal, Peter C. Patton, Ernest H. Forman","publish_date":"2007-03-01","description":"This is the eBook version of the printed book. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is an advanced technique that supports decision makers in structuring complex decisions, quantifying intangible factors, and evaluating choices in multiobjective decision situations. It is a comprehensive and rational decision-making framework that provides a powerful methodology for determining relative worth among a set of elements. AHP is especially suitable for complex decisions that involve the comparison of decision elements which are difficult to quantify. The AHP, and its more recent version the Analytic Network Process (ANP), were developed by Dr. Thomas Saaty and have been applied in a wide variety of decision situations in organizations worldwide. AHP is particularly applicable in managing software complexity, and in Quality Function Deployment (QFD), as presented in Chapter 11 of the book Design for Trustworthy Software. This short cut illustrates the application of AHP in prioritizing complex design issues. It also shows how AHP and its supporting software, Expert Choice (EC), can handle much higher levels of complexities accurately and expeditiously than the prioritization matrices introduced in Chapter 7 of Design for Trustworthy Software. In addition to solutions facilitated by EC, this short cut also illustrates two known approximations to AHP solutions using manual calculations. Manual calculations can be used to solve relatively less complex problems. They are presented in this short cut to illustrate the first principles and the steps involved in AHP. This short cut is a reproduction of Chapter 8 of the book Design for Trustworthy Software and introduces AHP with a simple example. It can be used either as a methodology in trustworthy software design process or as a standalone introductory presentation on AHP. This short cut should be of interest to software and quality professionals. In particular, it would be of value to the CMMI, Six Sigma, and DFSS communities worldwide, especially those who have acquired or plan to acquire Green Belt, Black Belt, Master Black Belt, or similar competencies in various quality management disciplines. It should also be a useful resource for students and academicians of various programs at senior undergraduate and graduate levels, and for those preparing for ASQ's Certified Software Quality Engineer (CSQE) examination.

Excerpt: The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is a compiler system produced by the GNU Project supporting various programming languages. GCC is a key component of the GNU toolchain. As well as being the official compiler of the unfinished GNU operating system, GCC has been adopted as the standard compiler by most other modern Unix-like computer operating systems, including Linux, the BSD family and Mac OS X. GCC has been ported to a wide variety of processor architectures, and is widely deployed as a tool in commercial, proprietary and closed source software development environments. GCC is also available for most embedded platforms, for example Symbian (called gcce), AMCC and Freescale Power Architecture-based chips. The compiler can target a wide variety of platforms, including videogame consoles such as the PlayStation 2 and Dreamcast. Several companies make a business out of supplying and supporting GCC ports to various platforms, and chip manufacturers today consider a GCC port almost essential to the success of an architecture. Originally named the GNU C Compiler, because it only handled the C programming language, GCC 1.0 was released in 1987, and the compiler was extended to compile C++ in December of that year.

This is an advanced text aimed at researchers and practitioners in the area of search and optimization. The book focuses on how MOEAs and related techniques can be used to solve problems, particularly in the disciplines of science and engineering. Contributions by leading researchers show how the concepts of multiobjective optimization can be used to reformulate and resolve problems in broad areas such as constrained optimization, coevolution, classification, inverse modelling and design. The book is distinguished from other texts on MOEAs in that it is not primarily about the algorithms, nor specific applications, but about the concepts and processes involved in solving problems using a multiobjective approach. Each chapter contributes to the central, deep concepts and themes of the book: evaluating the utility of the multiobjective approach; discussing alternative problem formulations; showing how problem formulation affects the search process; and examining solution selection and decision making. The book will be of benefit to researchers, practitioners and graduate students engaged with optimization-based problem solving. For multiobjective optimization experts, the book is an up-to-date account of emerging and advanced topics; for others, the book indicates how the multiobjective approach can lead to fresh insights.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Rg4USo2qv8oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":409,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Rg4USo2qv8oC&pg=PA263&dq=objective-c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=266&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9783540357506","title":"Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing – ICAISC 2006: 8th International Conference, Zakopane, Poland, June 25-29, 2006, Proceedings","author":"Leszek Rutkowski, Ryszard Tadeusiewicz, Lotfi A.

The aim of EVOLVE is to unify the perspectives offered by probability, set oriented numerics and evolutionary computation. EVOLVE focuses on challenging aspects that arise at the passage from theory to new paradigms and practice, elaborating on the foundations of evolutionary algorithms and theory-inspired methods merged with cutting-edge techniques that ensure performance guarantee factors. EVOLVE is also intended to foster a growing interest for robust and efficient methods with a sound theoretical background. The chapters enclose challenging theoretical findings, concrete optimization problems as well as new perspectives. By gathering contributions from researchers with different backgrounds, the book is expected to set the basis for a unified view and vocabulary where theoretical advancements may echo in different domains.","publisher":"Springer","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Fyq7BQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":414,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Fyq7BQAAQBAJ&dq=objective-c,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Fyq7BQAAQBAJ&pg=PA333&dq=objective-c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=273&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9783642237126","title":"Fuzzy Logic and Applications: 9th International Workshop, WILF 2011, Trani, Italy, August 29-31, 2011, Proceedings","author":"Alfredo Petrosino, Anna Maria Fanelli, Witold Pedrycz","publish_date":"2011-08-19","description":"This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the 9th International Workshop on Fuzzy Logic and Applications, WILF 2011 held in Trani, Italy in August 2011.

Whether a top manager interested in improving your organization’s results or a lone developer promoting a better way of working, this book will give you tools and ideas to help accomplish your goal.” –George Dinwiddie, independent coach and consultant, iDIA Computing, LLC “Keep the patterns in this book and Fearless Change handy. … These patterns transformed me from an ineffective ‘voice in the wilderness’ to a valued collaborator.” –Lisa Crispin, co-author (with Janet Gregory) of Agile Testing and More Agile Testing In their classic work, Fearless Change, Mary Lynn Manns and Linda Rising interviewed successful leaders of change, identified 48 patterns for implementing change in teams of all sizes, and demonstrated how to use these techniques effectively. Now, in More Fearless Change the authors reflect on all they’ve learned about their original patterns in the past decade, and introduce 15 powerful, new techniques–all extensively validated by change leaders worldwide. Manns and Rising teach strategies that appeal to each individual’s logic (head), feelings (heart), and desire to contribute (hands)–the best way to motivate real change and sustain it for the long haul. Learn how to Focus on the best things you can achieve with limited resources Strategize to build flexible plans and go after low-hanging fruit Get help from the right people in the right ways Establish emotional connections that inspire motivation and imagination Create an “elevator pitch” that keeps everyone focused on what truly matters Build bridges, work with skeptics, soften resistance, and open minds Uncover easier paths towards change, and build on what already works Sustain momentum, provide time for reflection, and celebrate small successes More Fearless Change reflects a profound understanding of how real change happens: not instantaneously in response to top-down plans and demands, but iteratively, through small steps that teach from experience. Best of all, as thousands of change agents have already discovered, its patterns are easy to use–and they work.","publisher":"Addison-Wesley Professional","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KLHEBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":336,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KLHEBgAAQBAJ&dq=objective-c,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KLHEBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA298&dq=objective-c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=286&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780123869425","title":"Numerical Methods: Using MATLAB","author":"George R.

If you work with numeric data in Excel and constantly run into data problems that take too long to fix, you should think about using VBA to speed through your problems. This is a formal and practical training guide that takes you from syntax rules to contextual illustrations, the most frequently used objects and useful concepts are exposed to show you how they might be used in the real world. Time saving shortcuts, syntax subtleties and programming implications are thoroughly annotated. This ebook gives more than basic demonstrations of syntax usage, a strong focus is given to Excel object manipulations and these operations are covered in complete sets of operations, while it's meaningful to show how to delete a column but a corporate problem typically requires you to find multiple columns that match some criteria before deleting them, so it's more meaningful if a demonstration shows how you might go about solving the problem from start to finish rather than showing a few lines of code for only the deletion itself, this ebook gives such comprehensive content. The typical Excel user doesn't need to create overly complex solutions, for this reason this manual doesn't cover peripheral topics that either extend VBA's reach or substitute it in impractical ways. This ebook is not too trivial but not too heavy either, topic-wise and computationally.

They are the framework of choice when designing an intelligent agent that needs to act for long periods of time in an environment where its actions could have uncertain outcomes. MDPs are actively researched in two related subareas of AI, probabilistic planning and reinforcement learning. Probabilistic planning assumes known models for the agent's goals and domain dynamics, and focuses on determining how the agent should behave to achieve its objectives. On the other hand, reinforcement learning additionally learns these models based on the feedback the agent gets from the environment. This book provides a concise introduction to the use of MDPs for solving probabilistic planning problems, with an emphasis on the algorithmic perspective. It covers the whole spectrum of the field, from the basics to state-of-the-art optimal and approximation algorithms. We first describe the theoretical foundations of MDPs and the fundamental solution techniques for them. We then discuss modern optimal algorithms based on heuristic search and the use of structured representations. A major focus of the book is on the numerous approximation schemes for MDPs that have been developed in the AI literature. These include determinization-based approaches, sampling techniques, heuristic functions, dimensionality reduction, and hierarchical representations. Finally, we briefly introduce several extensions of the standard MDP classes that model and solve even more complex planning problems.

It details the computation of robust optimal solutions, i.e., optimal solutions that are insensitive with respect to random parameter variations, where appropriate deterministic substitute problems are needed. Based on the probability distribution of the random data and using decision theoretical concepts, optimization problems under stochastic uncertainty are converted into appropriate deterministic substitute problems. Due to the probabilities and expectations involved, the book also shows how to apply approximative solution techniques. Several deterministic and stochastic approximation methods are provided: Taylor expansion methods, regression and response surface methods (RSM), probability inequalities, multiple linearization of survival/failure domains, discretization methods, convex approximation/deterministic descent directions/efficient points, stochastic approximation and gradient procedures and differentiation formulas for probabilities and expectations.

Pileggi, Carlos Fernandez-Llatas","publish_date":"2012-03","description":"Semantic technologies are experimenting an increasing popularity in the context of different domains and applications. The understanding of any class of system can be significantly changed under the assumption any system is part of a global ecosystem known as Semantic Web. The Semantic Web would be an evolving extension of current Web model (normally referred as Syntactic Web) that introduces a semantic layer in which semantics, or meaning of information, are formally defined. So, semantics should integrate web-centric standard information infrastructures improving several aspects of interaction among heterogeneous systems. This is because common interoperability models are progressively becoming obsolete if compared with the intrinsic complexity and always more distributed focus that feature modern systems. For example, the basic interoperability model, that assumes the interchange of messages among systems without any interpretation, is simple but effective only in the context of close environments. Also more advanced models, such as the functional interoperability model that integrates basic interoperability model with the ability of intepretating data context under the assumption of a shared schema for data fields accessing, appears not able to provide a full sustainable technologic support for open systems. The Semantic Interoperability model would improve common interoperability models introducing the interpretation of means of data. Semantic interoperability is a concretely applicable interaction model under the assumption of adopting rich data models (commonly called Ontology) composed of concepts within a domain and the relationships among those concepts. In practice, semantic technologies are partially inverting the common view at actor intelligence: intelligence is not implemented (only) by actors but it is implicitly resident in the knowledge model. In other words, schemas contain information and the \"code\" to interpretate it.","publisher":"River Publishers","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-wjjbIQ-u0YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":164,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-wjjbIQ-u0YC&pg=PA131&dq=objective-c,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=304&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9783540269731","title":"Database: Enterprise, Skills and Innovation: 22nd British National Conference on Databases, BNCOD 22, Sunderland, UK, July 5-7, 2005, Proceedings","author":"Mike Jackson, David Nelson, Sue Stirk","publish_date":"2005-06-24","description":"This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the 22nd British National Conference on Databases, BNCOD 22, held in Sunderland, UK in July 2005.
