Yukihiro \"Matz\" Matsumoto, creator, designer and lead developer of Ruby and author of Ruby in a Nutshell, which has been expanded and revised to become this book. why the lucky stiff, artist and Ruby programmer extraordinaire. This book begins with a quick-start tutorial to the language, and then explains the language in detail from the bottom up: from lexical and syntactic structure to datatypes to expressions and statements and on through methods, blocks, lambdas, closures, classes and modules. The book also includes a long and thorough introduction to the rich API of the Ruby platform, demonstrating -- with heavily-commented example code -- Ruby's facilities for text processing, numeric manipulation, collections, input/output, networking, and concurrency. An entire chapter is devoted to Ruby's metaprogramming capabilities. The Ruby Programming Language documents the Ruby language definitively but without the formality of a language specification. It is written for experienced programmers who are new to Ruby, and for current Ruby programmers who want to challenge their understanding and increase their mastery of the language.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jcUbTcr5XWwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":448,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jcUbTcr5XWwC&dq=ruby,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":47,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jcUbTcr5XWwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=ruby,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781430223634","title":"Beginning Ruby: From Novice to Professional","author":"Peter Cooper","publish_date":"2009-07-21","description":"Based on the bestselling first edition, Beginning Ruby: From Novice to Professional, Second Edition is the leading guide for every type of reader who wants to learn Ruby from the ground up.

What’s more, they can do it one step at a time, through a series of simple, proven steps. Now, there’s an authoritative and extensively updated version of Martin Fowler’s classic refactoring book that utilizes Ruby examples and idioms throughout–not code adapted from Java or any other environment. The authors introduce a detailed catalog of more than 70 proven Ruby refactorings, with specific guidance on when to apply each of them, step-by-step instructions for using them, and example code illustrating how they work. Many of the authors’ refactorings use powerful Ruby-specific features, and all code samples are available for download. Leveraging Fowler’s original concepts, the authors show how to perform refactoring in a controlled, efficient, incremental manner, so you methodically improve your code’s structure without introducing new bugs. Whatever your role in writing or maintaining Ruby code, this book will be an indispensable resource. This book will help you Understand the core principles of refactoring and the reasons for doing it Recognize “bad smells” in your Ruby code Rework bad designs into well-designed code, one step at a time Build tests to make sure your refactorings work properly Understand the challenges of refactoring and how they can be overcome Compose methods to package code properly Move features between objects to place responsibilities where they fit best Organize data to make it easier to work with Simplify conditional expressions and make more effective use of polymorphism Create interfaces that are easier to understand and use Generalize more effectively Perform larger refactorings that transform entire software systems and may take months or years Successfully refactor Ruby on Rails code","publisher":"Pearson Education","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6jyOUrJBJHAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":480,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6jyOUrJBJHAC&dq=ruby,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":4.5,"ratings_count":114,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6jyOUrJBJHAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=ruby,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781491925973","title":"Ruby Pocket Reference","author":"Michael Fitzgerald","publish_date":"2015-08-10","description":"Updated for Ruby 2.2, this handy reference offers brief yet clear explanations of Ruby’s core elements—from operators to blocks to documentation creation—and highlights the key features you may work with every day.

In Eloquent Ruby, Russ Olsen helps you write Ruby like true Rubyists do–so you can leverage its immense, surprising power. Olsen draws on years of experience internalizing the Ruby culture and teaching Ruby to other programmers. He guides you to the “Ah Ha!” moments when it suddenly becomes clear why Ruby works the way it does, and how you can take advantage of this language’s elegance and expressiveness. Eloquent Ruby starts small, answering tactical questions focused on a single statement, method, test, or bug. You’ll learn how to write code that actually looks like Ruby (not Java or C#); why Ruby has so many control structures; how to use strings, expressions, and symbols; and what dynamic typing is really good for. Next, the book addresses bigger questions related to building methods and classes. You’ll discover why Ruby classes contain so many tiny methods, when to use operator overloading, and when to avoid it. Olsen explains how to write Ruby code that writes its own code–and why you’ll want to. He concludes with powerful project-level features and techniques ranging from gems to Domain Specific Languages.

This book has improved my use of Ruby, and encouraged me to blow off the dust covering the GoF book.\" —Mike Stok \" Design Patterns in Ruby is a great way for programmers from statically typed objectoriented languages to learn how design patterns appear in a more dynamic, flexible language like Ruby.\" —Rob Sanheim, Ruby Ninja, Relevance Most design pattern books are based on C++ and Java. But Ruby is different—and the language's unique qualities make design patterns easier to implement and use. In this book, Russ Olsen demonstrates how to combine Ruby's power and elegance with patterns, and write more sophisticated, effective software with far fewer lines of code. After reviewing the history, concepts, and goals of design patterns, Olsen offers a quick tour of the Ruby language—enough to allow any experienced software developer to immediately utilize patterns with Ruby. The book especially calls attention to Ruby features that simplify the use of patterns, including dynamic typing, code closures, and \"mixins\" for easier code reuse. Fourteen of the classic \"Gang of Four\" patterns are considered from the Ruby point of view, explaining what problems each pattern solves, discussing whether traditional implementations make sense in the Ruby environment, and introducing Ruby-specific improvements. You'll discover opportunities to implement patterns in just one or two lines of code, instead of the endlessly repeated boilerplate that conventional languages often require. Design Patterns in Ruby also identifies innovative new patterns that have emerged from the Ruby community. These include ways to create custom objects with metaprogramming, as well as the ambitious Rails-based \"Convention Over Configuration\" pattern, designed to help integrate entire applications and frameworks. Engaging, practical, and accessible, Design Patterns in Ruby will help you build better software while making your Ruby programming experience more rewarding.","publisher":"Pearson Education","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QWOWqHANWoAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":384,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QWOWqHANWoAC&dq=ruby,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":42,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QWOWqHANWoAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=ruby,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=21&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781430201939","title":"Practical Ruby Gems","author":"David Berube","publish_date":"2007-09-09","description":"This book is a comprehensive guide to utilizing and creating Ruby Gems.

Each chapter has a standalone project in which a complete web application with specific features of a social networking site is emphasized. The final chapter of the book is a project that has a complete and fully developed social networking site. Each chapter begins with a brief description of the features of the Internet service and the market it is within. After extracting the main features of the service, the chapter goes into explaining how a clone of the service can be designed, followed by a short description of the technologies and platforms being used. The bulk of the chapter goes into describing how the clone is built, with step-by-step explanations and code examples. Finally, the chapter shows how the finished clone can be deployed on the Internet. This book is written for web application programmers with an intermediate knowledge of Ruby. You should also know how web applications work and you have used at least some of the cloned Internet services before. If you are a trying to find out exactly how can you make your very own customized applications such as TinyURL, Twitter, Flickr, or Facebook, this book is for you.

Ruby 2.0 is less radical--it has keyword arguments, a new regexp engine, and some library changes. This book describes it all. The first quarter of the book is a tutorial introduction that gets you up to speed with the Ruby language and the most important classes and libraries. Download and play with the hundreds of code samples as your experiment with the language. The second section looks at real-world Ruby, covering the Ruby environment, how to package, document, and distribute code, and how to work with encodings. The third part of the book is more advanced. In it, you'll find a full description of the language, an explanation of duck typing, and a detailed description of the Ruby object model and metaprogramming. The book ends with a reference section: comprehensive and detailed documentation of Ruby's libraries. You'll find descriptions and examples of more than 1,300 methods in 58 built-in classes and modules, along with brief descriptions of 97 standard libraries. Ruby makes your programming more productive; it makes coding fun again.

But can you also build web sites that are usable by machines? That's where the future lies, and that's what RESTful Web Services shows you how to do. The World Wide Web is the most popular distributed application in history, and Web services and mashups have turned it into a powerful distributed computing platform. But today's web service technologies have lost sight of the simplicity that made the Web successful. They don't work like the Web, and they're missing out on its advantages. This book puts the \"Web\" back into web services. It shows how you can connect to the programmable web with the technologies you already use every day. The key is REST, the architectural style that drives the Web. This book: Emphasizes the power of basic Web technologies -- the HTTP application protocol, the URI naming standard, and the XML markup language Introduces the Resource-Oriented Architecture (ROA), a common-sense set of rules for designing RESTful web services Shows how a RESTful design is simpler, more versatile, and more scalable than a design based on Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) Includes real-world examples of RESTful web services, like Amazon's Simple Storage Service and the Atom Publishing Protocol Discusses web service clients for popular programming languages Shows how to implement RESTful services in three popular frameworks -- Ruby on Rails, Restlet (for Java), and Django (for Python) Focuses on practical issues: how to design and implement RESTful web services and clients This is the first book that applies the REST design philosophy to real web services. It sets down the best practices you need to make your design a success, and the techniques you need to turn your design into working code. You can harness the power of the Web for programmable applications: you just have to work with the Web instead of against it.

In this comprehensive guide to Ruby optimization, you'll learn how to write faster Ruby code--but that's just the beginning. See exactly what makes Ruby and Rails code slow, and how to fix it. Alex Dymo will guide you through perils of memory and CPU optimization, profiling, measuring, performance testing, garbage collection, and tuning. You'll find that all those \"hard\" things aren't so difficult after all, and your code will run orders of magnitude faster. This is the first book ever that consolidates all the Ruby performance optimization advice in one place. It's your comprehensive guide to memory optimization, CPU optimization, garbage collector tuning, profiling, measurements, performance testing, and more. You'll go from performance rookie to expert. First, you'll learn the best practices for writing Ruby code that's easy not only on the CPU, but also on memory, and that doesn't trigger the dreaded garbage collector. You'll find out that garbage collection accounts for 80% of slowdowns, and often takes more than 50% of your program's execution time. And you'll discover the bottlenecks in Rails code and learn how selective attribute loading and preloading can mitigate the performance costs of ActiveRecord. As you advance to Ruby performance expert, you'll learn how profile your code, how to make sense out of profiler reports, and how to make optimization decisions based on them. You'll make sure slow code doesn't creep back into your Ruby application by writing performance tests, and you'll learn the right way to benchmark Ruby. And finally, you'll dive into the Ruby interpreter internals to really understand why garbage collection makes Ruby so slow, and how you can tune it up. What You Need: Some version of Ruby. The advice from this book applies to all modern Ruby versions from 1.9 to 2.2. 80% of the material will also be useful for legacy Ruby 1.8 users, and there is 1.8-specific advice as well.","publisher":null,"image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X45SrgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":170,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=X45SrgEACAAJ&dq=ruby,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=77&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781449359737","title":"RESTful Web APIs","author":"Leonard Richardson, Mike Amundsen, Sam Ruby","publish_date":"2013-09-12","description":"The popularity of REST in recent years has led to tremendous growth in almost-RESTful APIs that don’t include many of the architecture’s benefits.

Copeland","publish_date":"2015-11-25","description":"As a Rails developer, you care about user experience and performance, but you also want simple and maintainable code. Achieve all that by embracing the full stack of web development, from styling with Bootstrap, building an interactive user interface with AngularJS, to storing data quickly and reliably in PostgreSQL. Take a holistic view of full-stack development to create usable, high-performing applications, and learn to use these technologies effectively in a Ruby on Rails environment. Rails is a great tool for building web applications, but it's not the best at everything. Embrace the features built into your database. Learn how to use front-end frameworks. Seize the power of the application stack through AngularJS, Bootstrap, and PostgreSQL. When used together, these powerful and easy-to-use tools will open you to a new world of possibilities. In each chapter of this book, you'll learn how these technologies can work together inside a Rails app to deliver well-performing applications that offer great user experiences. Create a usable and attractive login form using Bootstrap's styles, while ensuring the database table backing it is secure, using Postgres' check constraints. You'll see how creating an advanced Postgres index for a case-insensitive search can speed up your back-end--allowing you to create a highly dynamic user experience using AngularJS. You'll create complex interfaces using Bootstrap's grid, together with Angular's form support, backed by a materialized view for caching within Postgres. You'll get your front-end working with the Asset Pipeline, use Postgres' features from migrations, and write unit tests for all of it. All of this within Rails. You'll gain the confidence to work at every level of the application stack, bringing the right solution to every problem. What You Need: You'll need the latest version of Ruby on Rails and have some experience with basic Rails concepts. You'll learn how to install Postgres on your computer or use a free version of it in the cloud. You should have a cursory understanding of JavaScript, CSS, and SQL, but by no means need to be an expert. You should install Postgres 9.4, Rails 4.2, and Ruby 2.2.","publisher":"Pragmatic Bookshelf","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L1T2sgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":240,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L1T2sgEACAAJ&dq=ruby,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=167&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9783453171831","title":"Tom Clancy's net force: Ehrenkodex : Roman / aus dem Amerikan. von Luis Ruby","author":"Tom Clancy, Steve Pieczenik","publish_date":"2000","description":"Commander Alexander Michaels und sein Team stehen vor einer schweren Aufgabe: ein psychopathischer Hacker gefährdet die öffentliche Sicherheit.

Furthermore, the runtime is the foundation for many useful software design and architecture techniques you can apply as you develop your .NET applications. Pro DLR in .NET 4 introduces you to the DLR, showing how you can use it to write software that combines dynamic and static languages, letting you choose the right tool for the job. You will learn the core DLR components such as LINQ expressions, call sites, binders, and dynamic objects—and how they work together to achieve language interoperability. You’ll see how to mix and match objects and functions from compiled and dynamic languages, so you can write code in the language of your choice while taking advantage of libraries written in other languages. And you'll discover how the various languages interoperate behind the scenes. With the basics out of the way, the book then details the various ways you can leverage the DLR in the design and architecture of your software applications. You’ll learn about runtime code generation, which lets you avoid much of the boilerplate code typical in layered business applications. You’ll see practical examples of using the DLR to build domain-specific languages, and you’ll learn how the DLR helps enable aspect-oriented programming.","publisher":"Apress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QGciuyBRyU0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":328,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QGciuyBRyU0C&dq=ruby,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QGciuyBRyU0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=ruby,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=170&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9785459005622","title":"Язык программирования Ruby: [пер. с англ.]","author":"Дэвид Флэнаган","publish_date":"2011","description":"Издание содержит: алгоритмизация и программирование, основные конструкции языка, примеры программ","publisher":null,"image_url":null,"total_pages":492,"written_language":"ru","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RWXhkQEACAAJ&dq=ruby,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=171&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780596521424","title":"Rails 3 in a Nutshell","author":"Cody Fauser, James MacAulay, Edward Ocampo-Gooding, John Guenin","publish_date":"2011-12-15","description":"Kick your web development skills into high gear by learning to build effective database-driven websites with Rails 3.

Copeland","publish_date":"2015-11-25","description":"As a Rails developer, you care about user experience and performance, but you also want simple and maintainable code. Achieve all that by embracing the full stack of web development, from styling with Bootstrap, building an interactive user interface with AngularJS, to storing data quickly and reliably in PostgreSQL. Take a holistic view of full-stack development to create usable, high-performing applications, and learn to use these technologies effectively in a Ruby on Rails environment. Rails is a great tool for building web applications, but it's not the best at everything. Embrace the features built into your database. Learn how to use front-end frameworks. Seize the power of the application stack through AngularJS, Bootstrap, and PostgreSQL. When used together, these powerful and easy-to-use tools will open you to a new world of possibilities. In each chapter of this book, you'll learn how these technologies can work together inside a Rails app to deliver well-performing applications that offer great user experiences. Create a usable and attractive login form using Bootstrap's styles, while ensuring the database table backing it is secure, using Postgres' check constraints. You'll see how creating an advanced Postgres index for a case-insensitive search can speed up your back-end--allowing you to create a highly dynamic user experience using AngularJS. You'll create complex interfaces using Bootstrap's grid, together with Angular's form support, backed by a materialized view for caching within Postgres. You'll get your front-end working with the Asset Pipeline, use Postgres' features from migrations, and write unit tests for all of it. All of this within Rails. You'll gain the confidence to work at every level of the application stack, bringing the right solution to every problem. What You Need: You'll need the latest version of Ruby on Rails and have some experience with basic Rails concepts. You'll learn how to install Postgres on your computer or use a free version of it in the cloud. You should have a cursory understanding of JavaScript, CSS, and SQL, but by no means need to be an expert. You should install Postgres 9.4, Rails 4.2, and Ruby 2.2.","publisher":"Pragmatic Bookshelf","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L1T2sgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":240,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L1T2sgEACAAJ&dq=ruby,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=177&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9783453171831","title":"Tom Clancy's net force: Ehrenkodex : Roman / aus dem Amerikan. von Luis Ruby","author":"Tom Clancy, Steve Pieczenik","publish_date":"2000","description":"Commander Alexander Michaels und sein Team stehen vor einer schweren Aufgabe: ein psychopathischer Hacker gefährdet die öffentliche Sicherheit.

What you'll find especially helpful are the worksheets. It is so much easier to write about a work experience using these outlines. It ensures that the narrative will follow a logical structure and reminds you not to leave out the most important points. With this book, you'll be able to revise your application into a much stronger document, be much better prepared and a step ahead for the next opportunity. The book comes filled with useful cheat sheets. It helps you get your career organized in a tidy, presentable fashion. It also will inspire you to produce some attention-grabbing cover letters that convey your skills persuasively and attractively in your application packets. After studying it, too, you'll be prepared for interviews, or you will be after you conducted the practice sessions where someone sits and asks you potential questions. It makes you think on your feet! This book makes a world of difference in helping you stay away from vague and long-winded answers and you will be finally able to connect with prospective employers, including the one that will actually hire you. This book successfully challenges conventional job search wisdom and doesn't load you with useful but obvious suggestions ('don't forget to wear a nice suit to your interview,' for example). Instead, it deliberately challenges conventional job search wisdom, and in so doing, offers radical but inspired suggestions for success. Think that 'companies approach hiring with common sense, logic, and good business acumen and consistency?' Think that 'the most qualified candidate gets the job?' Think again! Time and again it is proven that finding a job is a highly subjective business filled with innumerable variables. The triumphant jobseeker is the one who not only recognizes these inconsistencies and but also uses them to his advantage. Not sure how to do this? Don't worry-How to Land a Top-Paying Developers Job guides the way. Highly recommended to any harried Developers jobseeker, whether you want to work for the government or a company. You'll plan on using it again in your efforts to move up in the world for an even better position down the road. This book offers excellent, insightful advice for everyone from entry-level to senior professionals. None of the other such career guides compare with this one. It stands out because it: 1) explains how the people doing the hiring think, so that you can win them over on paper and then in your interview; 2) has an engaging, reader-friendly style; 3) explains every step of the job-hunting process - from little-known ways for finding openings to getting ahead on the job. This book covers everything. Whether you are trying to get your first Developers Job or move up in the system, get this book.","publisher":"Emereo Publishing","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Jq4BBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":90,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Jq4BBwAAQBAJ&dq=ruby,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=224&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780321606389","title":"The Merb Way","author":"Foy Savas","publish_date":"2009","description":"The first comprehensive guide to Merb - the highly-agile new Web development framework for Ruby * * Timely, relevant, and thorough: will publish right after the release of Merb 1.0, riding on growing excitement about Merb amongst Ruby and Rails developers worldwide. * Covers both Merb and the tools most widely used with it, including DataMapper * Follows the same successful format as our best-seller The Rails Way, and includes a foreword by Obie Fernandez, author of The Rails Way.

Iniciando com uma introdução completa ao panorama do Rails 3, conduziremos o leitor pela criação de aplicações funcionais, da instalação até a implantação, passando por tudo que envolve esse processo. O Rails 3 é modular por um bom motivo: a criação e manutenção de um software são facilitadas quando divididas de acordo com áreas de interesse. Cada capítulo deste livro foi projetado em torno de um componente específico do framework. Da modelagem dos relacionamentos de bancos de dados com a Active Record, ao envio de mensagens utilizando a Action Mailer, mostramos como cada um dos componentes trabalha em conjunto e onde são traçados os limites de responsabilidade. O resultado é que seu conhecimento será concentrado, e você saberá exatamente como as peças se encaixam. O Rails 3 é otimizado para atender àquilo que a maioria das pessoas tem de fazer, na maior parte do tempo, e este livro não é diferente. Nós nos concentramos nas técnicas que utilizamos diariamente como desenvolvedores que trabalham com o Rails. Com o auxílio de ferramentas online, como o Github, fica fácil acompanhar o texto e utilizar o código contido no livro. Depois de mostrar ao longo do livro como criar uma aplicação de blog, no último capítulo criamos um site de comércio eletrônico, utilizando um ritmo mais acelerado e demonstrando o processo de raciocínio usado ao criar aplicações para clientes reais. Neste livro, você encontrará conselhos e soluções práticas para problemas comuns. Mostraremos aquelas que, para nós, são as melhores técnicas e ferramentas que você pode utilizar quando trabalha com o Rails, além das mais valiosas boas práticas. Esperamos que você considere o texto útil, informativo e até divertido.

Risco Martín","publish_date":"2013-02-22","description":"In areas such as military, security, aerospace, and disaster management, the need for performance optimization and interoperability among heterogeneous systems is increasingly important. Model-driven engineering, a paradigm in which the model becomes the actual software, offers a promising approach toward systems of systems (SoS) engineering. However, model-driven engineering has largely been unachieved in complex dynamical systems and netcentric SoS, partly because modeling and simulation (M&S) frameworks are stove-piped and not designed for SoS composability. Addressing this gap, Netcentric System of Systems Engineering with DEVS Unified Process presents a methodology for realizing the model-driven engineering vision and netcentric SoS using DEVS Unified Process (DUNIP). The authors draw on their experience with Discrete Event Systems Specification (DEVS) formalism, System Entity Structure (SES) theory, and applying model-driven engineering in the context of a netcentric SoS. They describe formal model-driven engineering methods for netcentric M&S using standards-based approaches to develop and test complex dynamic models with DUNIP. The book is organized into five sections: Section I introduces undergraduate students and novices to the world of DEVS. It covers systems and SoS M&S as well as DEVS formalism, software, modeling language, and DUNIP. It also assesses DUNIP with the requirements of the Department of Defense’s (DoD) Open Unified Technical Framework (OpenUTF) for netcentric Test and Evaluation (T&E). Section II delves into M&S-based systems engineering for graduate students, advanced practitioners, and industry professionals. It provides methodologies to apply M&S principles to SoS design and reviews the development of executable architectures based on a framework such as the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF). It also describes an approach for building netcentric knowledge-based contingency-driven systems. Section III guides graduate students, advanced DEVS users, and industry professionals who are interested in building DEVS virtual machines and netcentric SoS. It discusses modeling standardization, the deployment of models and simulators in a netcentric environment, event-driven architectures, and more. Section IV explores real-world case studies that realize many of the concepts defined in the previous chapters. Section V outlines the next steps and looks at how the modeling of netcentric complex adaptive systems can be attempted using DEVS concepts. It touches on the boundaries of DEVS formalism and the future work needed to utilize advanced concepts like weak and strong emergence, self-organization, scale-free systems, run-time modularity, and event interoperability. This groundbreaking work details how DUNIP offers a well-structured, platform-independent methodology for the modeling and simulation of netcentric system of systems.","publisher":"CRC Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RlfRBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":712,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RlfRBQAAQBAJ&dq=ruby,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RlfRBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA115&dq=ruby,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=259&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781430229230","title":"More iPhone Cool Projects: Cool Developers Reveal the Details of their Cooler Apps","author":"Ben Smith, Danton Chin, Leon Palm, Dave Smith, Charles Smith, Claus Hoefele, Saul Mora, Arne de Vries, Joost van de Wijgerd, Scott Penberthy, Ben Kazez, Roderick Smith, Stephen Chin","publish_date":"2010-07-30","description":"Everyone is developing iPhone applications, and it's clear why.

Mantle, Ron Lichty","publish_date":"2012-09-16","description":"“Mantle and Lichty have assembled a guide that will help you hire, motivate, and mentor a software development team that functions at the highest level. Their rules of thumb and coaching advice are great blueprints for new and experienced software engineering managers alike.” —Tom Conrad, CTO, Pandora “I wish I’d had this material available years ago. I see lots and lots of ‘meat’ in here that I’ll use over and over again as I try to become a better manager. The writing style is right on, and I love the personal anecdotes.” —Steve Johnson, VP, Custom Solutions, DigitalFish All too often, software development is deemed unmanageable. The news is filled with stories of projects that have run catastrophically over schedule and budget. Although adding some formal discipline to the development process has improved the situation, it has by no means solved the problem. How can it be, with so much time and money spent to get software development under control, that it remains so unmanageable? In Managing the Unmanageable: Rules, Tools, and Insights for Managing Software People and Teams , Mickey W. Mantle and Ron Lichty answer that persistent question with a simple observation: You first must make programmers and software teams manageable. That is, you need to begin by understanding your people—how to hire them, motivate them, and lead them to develop and deliver great products. Drawing on their combined seventy years of software development and management experience, and highlighting the insights and wisdom of other successful managers, Mantle and Lichty provide the guidance you need to manage people and teams in order to deliver software successfully. Whether you are new to software management, or have already been working in that role, you will appreciate the real-world knowledge and practical tools packed into this guide.","publisher":"Addison-Wesley","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jZSS2uUi2zMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":464,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jZSS2uUi2zMC&dq=ruby,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":3.5,"ratings_count":3,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jZSS2uUi2zMC&pg=PA12&dq=ruby,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=265&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781137031693","title":"Credit Scoring, Response Modeling, and Insurance Rating: A Practical Guide to Forecasting Consumer Behavior","author":"S.
