[{"isbn":"9780596554873","title":"JavaScript: The Good Parts: The Good Parts","author":"Douglas Crockford","publish_date":"2008-05-08","description":"Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PXa2bby0oQ0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":172,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PXa2bby0oQ0C&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":99,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PXa2bby0oQ0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781449396947","title":"JavaScript Patterns","author":"Stoyan Stefanov","publish_date":"2010-09-09","description":"What's the best approach for developing an application with JavaScript?

If you are new to JavaScript, it will teach you the language. If you are already a JavaScript programmer, Part I will sharpen your skills and deepen your understanding of the language. Part II explains the scripting environment provided by web browsers, with a focus on DOM scripting with unobtrusive JavaScript. The broad and deep coverage of client-side JavaScript is illustrated with many sophisticated examples that demonstrate how to: Generate a table of contents for an HTML document Display DHTML animations Automate form validation Draw dynamic pie charts Make HTML elements draggable Define keyboard shortcuts for web applications Create Ajax-enabled tool tips Use XPath and XSLT on XML documents loaded with Ajax And much more Part III is a complete reference for core JavaScript. It documents every class, object, constructor, method, function, property, and constant defined by JavaScript 1.5 and ECMAScript Version 3.

Other JavaScript books use example scripts that have little bearing on real-world Web development and are useful only in the chapter at hand. In contrast, Peter-Paul Koch's book uses eight real-world scripts he created for real-world clients in order to earn real-world money. That means the scripts are guaranteed to do something useful (and sellable!) that enhances the usability of the page they're used on. The book's example scripts include one that sorts a data table according to the user's search queries, a form validation script, a script that shows form fields only when the user needs them, a drop-down menu, and a data retrieval script that uses simple Ajax and shows the data in an animation. After an overview of JavaScript's purpose, Peter-Paul provides theoretical chapters on the context (jobs for JavaScript, CSS vs. JavaScript), the browsers (debugging, the arcana of the browser string), and script preparation. Then follow practical chapters on Core, BOM, Events, DOM, CSS Modification, and Data Retrieval, all of which are explained through a combination of theoretical instruction and the taking apart of the relevant sections of the example scripts.","publisher":"New Riders","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oUpYRNKCjrgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":400,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oUpYRNKCjrgC&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":10,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oUpYRNKCjrgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=15&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781449319267","title":"Learning PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, and CSS: A Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Dynamic Websites","author":"Robin Nixon","publish_date":"2012-08-27","description":"Provides information on creating interactive Web sites using a combination of PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, and CSS.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8-QyaeyEXHkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":556,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":9,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8-QyaeyEXHkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=16&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780596527747","title":"Head First JavaScript","author":"Michael Morrison","publish_date":"2007-12-20","description":"Provides information on scripting Web applications with JavaScript.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xsmBjw814qwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":615,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":3.5,"ratings_count":42,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xsmBjw814qwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781449393632","title":"Supercharged JavaScript Graphics: With HTML5 Canvas, JQuery, and More","author":"Raffaele Cecco","publish_date":"2011-07-18","description":"Provides information on using JavaScript, jQuery, and HTML5 Canvas to create Web applications for desktop and mobile devices.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IFq093JnK9QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":260,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IFq093JnK9QC&printsec=frontcover&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781111526504","title":"Principles of Program Design: Problem-Solving with JavaScript","author":"Paul Addison","publish_date":"2011-02-22","description":"From the respected instructor and author Paul Addison, PRINCIPLES OF PROGRAM DESIGN: PROBLEM SOLVING WITH JAVASCRIPT gives your students the fundamental concepts of good program design, illustrated and reinforced by hands-on examples using JavaScript.

It also gives a general introduction to XML, DTDs and XSLT, before showing how to automate the importing and exporting of XML data.Learn proacively through step-by-step tutorials on creating JavaScript solutions: the Try it for yourself! approach allows you to see for yourself how scripts are put together.Create scripts that manipulate text and images, build documents automatically and output them as interactive PDFs.Become familiar with the InDesign object model: as you work through the book, you will make repeated use of the essential syntax for manipulating InDesign objects such as document, pages, text frames, graphics and preferences.Create user interfaces to make your scripts more flexible and user-friendly. Rather than just creating scripts which always perform the same steps, you will learn to user ScriptUI to provide users with the ability to make choices that determine what the script will do.Learn how to automate XML import and export and provide an interface which allows the user to filter import by supplying parameter values.","publisher":"TrainingCompany.Com Books","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1aj1FofthiwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":520,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1aj1FofthiwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781449342883","title":"JavaScript Enlightenment","author":"Cody Lindley","publish_date":"2013","description":"\"From library user to JavaScript developer\"--Cover.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QedCPXDfzjAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":147,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QedCPXDfzjAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780137084760","title":"JavaScript by Example","author":"Ellie Quigley","publish_date":"2010-10-05","description":"The World’s Easiest Java Script Tutorial—Fully Updated!

The combination of MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js has become so popular that it has earned the title MEAN stack -- the subject of this book. This book explores the MEAN stack in detail. We will begin by covering Node.js, as it will lay the groundwork for all of our server-side work. You will learn how to get Node running on your local machine as well as download modules using npm. The key aspects of the Node.js programming model will also be covered. From there, we will move on to MongoDB, where you'll learn how to interact with Mongo from a Node application. You will also learn how to create, retrieve, update, and delete data from a Mongo store. After you have a solid grasp on Node and Mongo, the book will move on to the Express web server. We'll cover the basics of Express applications via topics like routes and middleware. Building on previous chapters, we will cover the integration of Node, Mongo, and Express. Our coverage of the MEAN stack will wrap up with several chapters on AngularJS. These chapters will cover Angular fundamentals like data binding, directives, controllers, routing, and services. In an effort to explore competing technologies, a slight introduction to Ember.js will also be provided. Full stack JavaScript is not fully encompassed by the MEAN stack. There is an entire ecosystem of JavaScript tools to learn about, and this book will introduce a few of them. We will cover task runners Gulp.js and Grunt.js which are extremely useful for automating mundane, repetitive tasks. We'll also cover JSHint, a linting tool used to improve code quality. Linting tools analyze source code and report potentials issues - a feature that is especially useful in non-compiled languages like JavaScript.","publisher":"SitePoint","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XhajBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":300,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XhajBgAAQBAJ&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XhajBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=98&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781118057322","title":"Beginning HTML, XHTML, CSS, and JavaScript","author":"Jon Duckett","publish_date":"2011-02-17","description":null,"publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vOZLwYJHymQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":864,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vOZLwYJHymQC&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":3.0,"ratings_count":2,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vOZLwYJHymQC&pg=PA528&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=99&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780596554958","title":"JavaScript & DHTML Cookbook","author":"Danny Goodman","publish_date":"2007-08-08","description":"In today's Web 2.0 world, JavaScript and Dynamic HTML are at the center of the hot new approach to designing highly interactive pages on the client side. With this environment in mind, the new edition of this book offers bite-sized solutions to very specific scripting problems that web developers commonly face. Each recipe includes a focused piece of code that you can insert right into your application. Why is JavaScript & DHTML Cookbook so popular? After reading thousands of forum threads over the years, author and scripting pioneer Danny Goodman has compiled a list of problems that frequently vex scripters of various experience levels. For every problem he addresses, Goodman not only offers code, but a discussion of how and why the solution works. Recipes range from simple tasks, such as manipulating strings and validating dates in JavaScript, to entire libraries that demonstrate complex tasks, such as cross-browser positioning of HTML elements, sorting tables, and implementing Ajax features on the client. Ideal for novices as well as experienced scripters, this book contains more than 150 recipes for: Working with interactive forms and style sheets Presenting user-friendly page navigation Creating dynamic content via Document Object Model scripting Producing visual effects for stationary content Positioning HTML elements Working with XML data in the browser Recipes in this Cookbook are compatible with the latest W3C standards and browsers, including Internet Explorer 7, Firefox 2, Safari, and Opera 9. Several new recipes provide client-side Ajax solutions, and many recipes from the previous edition have been revised to help you build extensible user interfaces for Web 2.0 applications.

JavaScript is in the top ten most-used programming languages world wide, and is the basis for applications that can run in any modern browser, on any device from smart phone to tablet to PC. Especial emphasis is given to touch-based interface, but all games also run using a regular mouse and keyboard setup. The four games you’ll develop from reading this book are: Painter Jewel Jam Penguin Pairs Tick Tick These four games are casual, arcade-style games representing the aim-and-shoot, puzzle, maze, and platform styles of game play. The approach in Building JavaScript Games follows the basic structure of a game rather than the syntax of a language. From almost the very first chapter you are building games to run on your phone or other device and show to your friends. Successive projects teach about handling player input, manipulating game objects, designing game worlds, managing levels, and realism through physics. All told, you’ll develop four well-designed games, making Building JavaScript Games one of the most enjoyable ways there is to learn about programming browser-based games. The final chapters in the book contain a very nice bonus of sorts. In them you will find excerpts from interviews with two prominent people from the game industry: Mark Overmars, who is CTO of Tingly Games and creator of GameMaker, and Peter Vesterbacka, the CMO of Rovio Entertainment - the creators of the Angry Birds franchise. Their insight and perspective round off what is already a fun and valuable book.","publisher":"Apress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E_amBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":444,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=E_amBAAAQBAJ&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=E_amBAAAQBAJ&pg=PR27&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=165&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781782160632","title":"JavaScript Unit Testing","author":"Hazem Saleh","publish_date":"2013-01-01","description":"A practical, example-driven guide to using, automating, and integrating JavaScript Unit tests for the busy and conscientious JavaScript developer striving for excellence and success.

First, JavaScript Allongé gives you the tools to deal with JavaScript bugs, hitches, edge cases, and other potential pitfalls. There are plenty of good directions for how to write JavaScript programs. If you follow them without alteration or deviation, you will be satisfied. Unfortunately, software is a complex thing, full of interactions and side-effects. Two perfectly reasonable pieces of advice when taken separately may conflict with each other when taken together. An approach may seem sound at the outset of a project, but need to be revised when new requirements are discovered. When you “leave the path” of the directions, you discover their limitations. In order to solve the problems that occur at the edges, in order to adapt and deal with changes, in order to refactor and rewrite as needed, you need to understand the underlying principles of the JavaScript programming language in detail. You need to understand why the directions work so that you can understand how to modify them to work properly at or beyond their original limitations. That’s where JavaScript Allongé comes in. JavaScript Allongé is a book about programming with functions, because JavaScript is a programming language built on flexible and powerful functions. JavaScript Allongé begins at the beginning, with values and expressions, and builds from there to discuss types, identity, functions, closures, scopes, and many more subjects up to working with classes and instances. In each case, JavaScript Allongé takes care to explain exactly how things work so that when you encounter a problem, you’ll know exactly what is happening and how to fix it. Second, JavaScript Allongé provides recipes for using functions to write software that is simpler, cleaner, and less complicated than alternative approaches that are object-centric or code-centric. JavaScript idioms like function combinators and decorators leverage JavaScript’s power to make code easier to read, modify, debug and refactor, thus avoiding problems before they happen. JavaScript Allongé teaches you how to handle complex code, and it also teaches you how to simplify code without dumbing it down. As a result, JavaScript Allongé is a rich read releasing many of JavaScript’s subtleties, much like the Café Allongé beloved by coffee enthusiasts everywhere.

This process involves much more than just technical knowledge, and this book provides you with all the information you'll need to understand the concepts behind designing and developing for the Web, as well as the best means to deliver professional, best-practice-based results. There is far more to building a successful website than knowing a little Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The process starts long before any coding takes place, and this book introduces you to the agile development process, explaining why this method makes so much sense for web projects and how best to implement it. Planning is vital, so you'll also learn how to use techniques such as brainstorming, wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to get your project off to the best possible start and help ensure smooth progress as it develops. An understanding of correct, semantic markup is essential to any web professional, so this book explains how XHTML should be used to structure content so that the markup adheres to current web standards. You'll learn about the wide range of HTML elements available to you, and you'll learn how and when to use them through building example web pages. Without creative use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), websites would all look largely the same. CSS gives you the ability to set your website apart from the rest while maintaining the integrity of your markup. You'll learn how CSS works and how to apply styles to your pages, enabling you to realize your design ideas in the browser. JavaScript can be used to make your website easier and more interesting to use. This book provides information on appropriate uses of this technology and introduces the concepts of programming using it. You'll also see how JavaScript works as part of the much-hyped technique Ajax and in turn where Ajax fits into the wider Web 2.0 picture. While a website is being built, it needs to be tested across multiple browsers and platforms to ensure that the site works for all users, regardless of ability or disability, and the book explains how best to do these tasks. Then, it discusses the process of launching and maintaining the site so that it will continue to work for all its users throughout its life-cycle. The book concludes by covering server-side technologies, acting as a guide to the different options available and explaining differences between available products. With insights from renowned experts such as Jason Fried of 37signals, Daniel Burka of Digg and Pownce, and Chris Messina of Citizen Agency, this book provides invaluable information applicable to every web project, regardless of size, scope, or budget.","publisher":"Apress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=295iDEn7YCYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":275,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=295iDEn7YCYC&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=295iDEn7YCYC&pg=PA226&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=185&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781849515115","title":"Sencha Touch Mobile JavaScript Framework","author":"John E.

Today, the stunning motion design of iOS and Android dramatically improves a user’s experience — instead of detracting from it. The best sites and apps of today leverage animation to improve the feel and intuitiveness of their interfaces. Sites without animation are starting to feel antiquated. This book provides you with a technical foundation to implement animation in a way that’s both visually stunning and programmatically maintainable. Throughout, we consider the balance between enriching a page with motion design while avoiding unnecessary flourishes Readers will learn how to design loading sequences that ensure users stay fully engaged instead of tuning out, how to leverage simple physics principles to make apps respond naturally to users’ input (just like motion behaves in the real world), how to exploit CSS transforms to create rich depth in animations, and how to fully leverage JavaScript animation libraries like Velocity.js to streamline animation programming. From animation performance to theory, we cover everything needed to become a professional web animator. Whether you're a novice or professional web developer, this book is for everyone. Why is all of this so important? Why is it worth your time to become a professional motion designer? For the same reason that designers spend hours perfecting their pages’ font and color combinations, motion designers perfect their animations’ transition and easing combinations: Refined products feel superior. They leave users whispering to themselves, “Wow, this is cool”, right before they turn to a friend and exclaim, “You gotta try this.”","publisher":"Peachpit Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4Wo0BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":192,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4Wo0BwAAQBAJ&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4Wo0BwAAQBAJ&pg=PT95&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=195&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781783286041","title":"JavaScript and JSON Essentials","author":"Sai Srinivas Sriparasa","publish_date":"2013-10-24","description":"The book follows a tutorial-based approach and will teach you how to work with JSON tools, design JSON objects, and how to use different techniques to handle JSON data.This book is a great resource for developers who would like to learn more about JSON and who wish to apply it in their own projects.

It has no concept of classes, and you don’t even need to define any objects in order to write code. But don’t be fooled—JavaScript is an incredibly powerful and expressive object-oriented language that puts many design decisions right into your hands. In The Principles of Object-Oriented JavaScript, Nicholas C. Zakas thoroughly explores JavaScript’s object-oriented nature, revealing the language’s unique implementation of inheritance and other key characteristics. You’ll learn: * The difference between primitive and reference values * What makes JavaScript functions so unique * The various ways to create objects * How to define your own constructors * How to work with and understand prototypes * Inheritance patterns for types and objects The Principles of Object-Oriented JavaScript will leave even experienced developers with a deeper understanding of JavaScript.

You'll see how to use R to interrogate and analyze your data, and then use the D3 JavaScript library to format and display that data in an elegant, informative, and interactive way. You will learn how to gather data effectively, and also how to understand the philosophy and implementation of each type of chart, so as to be able to represent the results visually. With the popularity of the R language, the art and practice of creating data visualizations is no longer the preserve of mathematicians, statisticians, or cartographers. As technology leaders, we can gather metrics around what we do and use data visualizations to communicate that information. Pro Data Visualization using R and JavaScript combines the power of the R language with the simplicity and familiarity of JavaScript to display clear and informative data visualizations. Gathering and analyzing empirical data is the key to truly understanding anything. We can track operational metrics to quantify the health of our products in production. We can track quality metrics of our projects, and even use our data to identify bad code. Visualizing this data allows anyone to read our analysis and easily get a deep understanding of the story the data tells.","publisher":"Apress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=c5GqBZfydgIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":216,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c5GqBZfydgIC&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c5GqBZfydgIC&pg=PA16&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=238&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780470633908","title":"Professional XMPP Programming with JavaScript and jQuery","author":"Jack Moffitt","publish_date":"2010-04-29","description":null,"publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nb1wRgrJ8boC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":480,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nb1wRgrJ8boC&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nb1wRgrJ8boC&pg=PA243&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=239&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781430237907","title":"Foundation Website Creation with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript","author":"Joe Lewis, Jonathan Lane, Meitar Moscovitz, Tom Barker","publish_date":"2012-09-05","description":"Foundation Website Creation with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript shows the entire process of building a website. This process involves much more than just technical knowledge, and this book provides all the information you'll need to understand the concepts behind designing and developing for the Web, as well as the best means to deliver professional results based on best practices. Of course, there is far more to building a successful website than knowing a little Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The process starts long before any coding takes place, and this book introduces you to the agile development process, explaining why this method makes so much sense for web projects and how best to implement it. We also make sure you're up to date by using the latest HTML5 features. Planning is vital, so you'll also learn to use techniques such as brainstorming, wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to get your project off to the best possible start and help ensure smooth progress as it develops. An understanding of correct, semantic markup is essential for any web professional; this book explains how HTML5 should be used to structure content so that the markup adheres to current web standards. You'll learn about the wide range of HTML5 elements available to you, and you'll learn how and when to use them through building example web pages. Without creative use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), websites would all look largely the same. CSS enables you to set your website apart from the rest, while maintaining the integrity of your markup. We'll showcase the new features of CSS3 and how you can use them. You'll learn how CSS3 works and how to apply styles to your pages, allowing you to realize your design ideas in the browser. JavaScript can be used to make your website easier and more interesting to use. This book provides information on appropriate uses of this technology and introduces the concepts of JavaScript programming. You'll also see how JavaScript works as part of the much-hyped technique Ajax, and in turn, where Ajax fits into the wider Web 2.0 picture. While a website is being built, it needs to be tested across multiple browsers and platforms to ensure that the site works for all users, regardless of ability or disability, and this book explains how best to accomplish these tasks. Then, it discusses the process of launching and maintaining the site so that it will continue to work for all its users throughout its life cycle. Foundation Website Creation with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript concludes by covering server-side technologies, acting as a guide to the different options available. With insights from renowned experts such as Jason Fried of 37signals, Daniel Burka of Digg and Pownce, and Chris Messina of Citizen Agency, Foundation Website Creation with CSS, XHTML, and JavaScript provides invaluable information applicable to every web project—regardless of size, scope, or budget.","publisher":"Apress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-m08A3lsSUgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":296,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-m08A3lsSUgC&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-m08A3lsSUgC&pg=PA253&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=240&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781782165217","title":"Instant Interactive Map Designs with Leaflet JavaScript Library How-to","author":"Jonathan Derrough","publish_date":"2013-05-22","description":"Filled with practical, step-by-step instructions and clear explanations for the most important and useful tasks.

Everything had to be written from scratch, every browser worked differently, and common development niceties like debuggers didn’t exist. Now JavaScript has all of the tools that developers need. Libraries like jQuery, AngularJS, Backbone.js and Ember.js make it easier to support a wide variety of browsers. Unit testers like Yui Test and QUnit make it possible to write rock solid, tested code. And all modern browsers included a suite of developer tools to ease the pains of building web apps. We have chosen in this bibliography a selection of JavaScript books that can take you from newbie all the way to ninja. Begin by learning the basics and best practices. Once you are comfortable, move onto more advanced topics like unit testing, performance enhancements, and design patterns. Learn how libraries like AngularJS, Backbone.js, Ember.js and jQuery can increase your productivity. Step into the fast growing world of mobile development with web frameworks like jQuery Mobile and cross-platform frameworks like PhoneGap. And finally, go full circle with JavaScript on the server with Node.js. With JavaScript you can create dynamic websites for desktop and mobile browsers, create fast and efficient servers, and build apps to sell for nearly every smartphone market place.

This revolution (or more correctly - evolution) has happened for a number of reasons: Browsers have introduced new standards-based APIs allowing web applications to (amongst other things) store data offline, retrieve data from the server dynamically, spawn background processes and interact with the filesystem. Software engineers and programmers have begun to think of the much maligned JavaScript language in a new light, and unlock its potential as a rich and expressive language capable of producing large scale, well-structured applications. The jQuery library has eased the pain of interacting with Document Object Model, and therefore writing applications that dynamically respond to user interaction. The HTML markup language has been overhauled and extended to provide more semantic meaning, and many additional elements and attributes. A Software Engineer Learns HTML5, JavaScript and jQuery guides you through the process I went through as an experienced software engineer, writing a large-scale, standards based web-application for the first time. It is intended to teach you the fundamentals of HTML5, JavaScript and jQuery - without presenting you with long lists of APIs, or intricate details of every feature (these can be found in reference manuals). This book is not a simple introduction to the subject matter: it guides you through the process of building a feature-rich web application. The application begins simple, and becomes gradually more complex as additional APIs and features are introduced. This book includes the following content: An introduction to the HTML5 markup language, and how it differs from HTML4 and XHTML. An introduction to JavaScript, including an in-depth look at its use of objects and functions, along with the design patterns that support the development of robust web applications. An introduction to jQuery selection, traversal, manipulation and events. An in-depth look at the Web storage and IndexedDB APIs for client side data storage. A guide to implementing offline web applications with the Application Cache API. An introduction to the ways JavaScript can interact with the users file-system using the FileReader API.

Interactive forms that respond to data entry by the user require some programming. Dynamic forms also have to work seamlessly with the database that collects customer information. Plus, forms need to be designed well to eliminate confusion and entice completion by the user. As shown in this book, LiveCycle Designer addresses the many objectives of forms creation. It offers a digital handshake between the graphic designer and the data programmer. LiveCycle Designer lets form designers create more compelling and dynamic documents than is possible with Acrobat or Microsoft Word. Forms created with LiveCycle Designer automatically expand to accommodate different amounts of data and report that information back to a database. The new version of LiveCycle Designer (ES4) allows for the first time forms to be deployed in HTML5 format, so they can be used on a wider array of devices (page sizes can adjust to smaller screens) and in a wider range of software systems (no special reader or plugin needed to use them, just a Web browser).

The book uses JavaScript, a popular programming language for creating websites and scripting. Aimed at kids who already play Minecraft, this guide will teach coding through a series of \"Recipes\" (the term used in-game when crafting new objects). For example, in the game, one of the first things any player must do is create a Workbench, or Crafting Table, which will in turn enable the player to create sophisticated tools. Recipe 1 in the book (the term Recipe and Chapter is interchangeable) is 'A modding Workbench' and its ingredients are the tools the reader will need to begin modding. The goal of each Recipe/chapter is to introduce a new JavaScript concept or expand upon a previously introduced concept. The author will present each recipe as a useful addition to the game while gently introducing programming concepts in an approachable style. This unique approach gets over the problem of introducing JavaScript in an interesting way and avoids spending 3 or 4 chapters explaining JavaScript core concepts in a vacuum.

However, Java and JavaScript are very distinctively different languages (although the name suggests otherwise), therefore requiring a different development process. In Beginning Google Web Toolkit: From Novice to Professional, you'll learn to build rich, user–friendly web applications using a popular Java–based Ajax web framework, the Google Web Toolkit. The authors will guide you through the complete development of a GWT front-end application with a no–nonsense, down–to–earth approach. You'll start with the first steps of working with GWT and learn to understand the concepts and consequences of building this kind of application. During the course of the book, all the key aspects of GWT are tackled pragmatically, as you're using them to build a real–world sample application.

That is why every web developer should know how to use JavaScript. The problem is that JavaScript is surprisingly difficult to learn, not only for programming novices but also for experienced programmers. But now, Murachs JavaScript makes it easier than ever to become an accomplished JavaScript programmer. To make that possible, section 1 of this book presents a six-chapter course in JavaScript that gets you off to a great start. This section works for programming novices as well as experienced programmers because it lets you set your own pace. When you finish this section, you will be able to write, test and debug JavaScript applications of your own. Then, section 2 builds on that base by presenting the additional skills that every JavaScript programmer must have. That includes working with arrays and web storage, creating and using your own object types in object-oriented applications, using regular expressions for data validation, and much more. For many developers, sections 1 and 2 will be all that they need to know. But for those who want to move on to the expert level, section 3 presents the skills that will get you there. That includes skills like how to bulletproof your applications by using closures, namespaces, and modules; how to make your functions more useful by using callbacks; and how to use JSON to transmit and store data.

It also shows how object programming (OP) opens a new world of design possibilities that go far beyond inheritance. This book will help the intermediate JavaScript programmer learn to use both types of inheritance. For classical inheritance, it is accompanied by a substantial online system (a windowing UI library) that shows classical inheritance at its best. The same system shows how OP \"capabilities\" can eliminate much of the need for inheritance. For experienced JavaScript programmers, this book shows why most of the old views of JavaScript's inheritance have not done it justice. JavaScript classes inherit from JavaScript's prototypes, a fact that makes JavaScript's prototypes, when used correctly, functional equivalents to C++ classes (not to prototypes in true prototypical languages, like Self). JavaScript's object programming (not inheritance) is what separates it from classical OOP languages like C++ and Java. Most important, basing inheritance on JavaScript's prototypal chain is possible, but is not the best choice for prototypal inheritance or classical inheritance. What You'll Learn What are objects, JavaScript objects and object programming What is and how to use inheritance and JavaScript inheritance as well as inheritance alternatives How to design for JavaScript What are and how to use OO principles in JavaScript How to use Constructors with JavaScript and more AudienceThis book is for both intermediate and advanced JavaScript and Web development programmers.

Whether you use Node.js, Express, MongoDB, jQuery, AngularJS, or directly manipulate the DOM, you can test-drive JavaScript. Learn the craft of writing meaningful, deterministic automated tests with Karma, Mocha, and Chai. Test asynchronous JavaScript, decouple and properly mock out dependencies, measure code coverage, and create lightweight modular designs of both server-side and client-side code. Your investment in writing tests will pay high dividends as you create code that's predictable and cost-effective to change.Design and code JavaScript applications with automated tests. Writing meaningful tests is a skill that takes learning, some unlearning, and a lot of practice, and with this book, you'll hone that skill. Fire up the editor and get hands-on through practical exercises for effective automated testing and designing maintainable, modular code.Start by learning when and why to do manual testing vs. automated verification. Focus tests on the important things, like the pre-conditions, the invariants, complex logic, and gnarly edge cases. Then begin to design asynchronous functions using automated tests. Carefully decouple and mock out intricate dependencies such as the DOM, geolocation API, file and database access, and Ajax calls to remote servers.Step by step, test code that uses Node.js, Express, MongoDB, jQuery, and AngularJS. Know when and how to use tools such as Chai, Istanbul, Karma, Mocha, Protractor, and Sinon. Create tests with minimum effort and run them fast without having to spin up web servers or manually edit HTML pages to run in browsers. Then explore end-to-end testing to ensure all parts are wired and working well together.Don't just imagine creating testable code, write it.What You Need: A computer with a text editor and your favorite browser. The book provides instructions to install the necessary automated testing-related tools.","publisher":null,"image_url":null,"total_pages":200,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2sR5jwEACAAJ&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=353&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781930110311","title":"JavaScript in Action","author":"","publish_date":"2002-03","description":"An informative guide examines the vital issues for programming JavaScript in an open, informed, and illustrated environment, from programming languages, flow contol, and functions, to JavaScript idiosyncrasies and DHTML.

Brooks","publish_date":"2009-03-01","description":"The best way to become acquainted with a subject is to write a book about it. —Benjamin Disraeli i. Background The purpose of this book is provide an introduction to using a server-side programming language to solve some kinds of computing problems that cannot be solved with a client-side language such as JavaScript. The language is PHP (originally created in 1994 by Danish/Icelandic programmer Rasmus Lerdorf as “Personal Home Page Tools” for dealing with his own web site). The PHP language does not have a formal specification, as C does, for example. It is developed and maintained by a User Group of volunteers and is, essentially, defined by the most recently available free download. Although this might seem to be a shaky foundation on which to make a commitment to learning a programming language, PHP has a very large world-wide base of users and applications, which ensures its role into the foreseeable future. This book should not be considered as a PHP reference source and it does not deal exhaustively even with those elements of the PHP language used in the book. (This should be considered a blessing by the casual programmer. ) If you need more information, there is a huge amount of information online about PHP. Hopefully, this book will help you filter this information to focus on solving typical science and engineering problems. An excellent online source for information about PHP is http://www. php. net/manual/en/index. php, maintained by the PHP 1 Documentation Group.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WVTBxbvw5zQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":141,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WVTBxbvw5zQC&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WVTBxbvw5zQC&pg=PA24&dq=javascript,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=356&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9783868993899","title":"JavaScript kurz & gut","author":"David Flanagan","publish_date":"2012-07-01","description":"JavaScript ist eine mächtige, objektorientierte Skriptsprache, deren Code in HTML-Seiten eingebettet und vom Browser interpretiert und ausgeführt wird.

Diese Kurzreferenz ist ein Auszug aus der überarbeiteten und ergänzten Neuauflage von JavaScript – Das umfassende Referenzwerk, 6. Auflage, der JavaScript-Bibel schlechthin. JavaScript kurz & gut befasst sich in den ersten neun Kapiteln mit der neuesten Version des Sprachkerns (ECMAScript 5) und behandelt die Syntax der Sprache, Typen, Werte, Variablen, Operatoren und Anweisungen sowie Objekte, Arrays, Funktionen und Klassen. All dies ist nicht nur für die Verwendung von JavaScript in Webbrowsern, sondern auch beim Einsatz von Node auf der Serverseite relevant. In den folgenden fünf Kapiteln geht es um die Host-Umgebung des Webbrowsers. Es wird erklärt, wie Sie clientseitiges JavaScript für die Erstellung dynamischer Webseiten und -applikationen verwenden und mit JavaScript auf die HTML5-APIs zugreifen.
