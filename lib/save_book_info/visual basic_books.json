Paul Vick, the father of Visual Basic .NET, explains the whys and hows of this exciting new language better than any other human being on the planet.” —Ted Pattison, Barracuda.NET “The Visual Basic .NET Programming Language includes nuances that in all my use and study of VB .NET, I haven’t seen discussed anywhere else. For example, I learned that you can use the Imports statement to import an Enum name, so that you needn’t refer to the enum in all its uses. In addition, I learned that the dictionary lookup operator, ‘!’, works in VB .NET—I thought this one had been retired. In any case, if you’re searching for a book that covers all the language syntax issues, and more, Paul Vick’s book is a great place to look.” —Ken Getz, Senior Consultant, MCW Technologies, LLC “This book is an excellent stepping stone for Visual Basic developers wanting to get their toes wet in the .NET waters. Paul’s presentation of the core topics all VB developers should tackle first is clear, concise, and unlike other books in the genre, does not overwhelm the reader. The VB6 vs. VB.NET task-oriented approach guides you through the new language and OO features, and then moves to basic threading and other CLR topics—as well as to the key points in the COM to .NET transition—in a well thought-out sequence. If you’ve been holding out on VB .NET, this is a great book to get you started.” —Klaus H. Probst, Sr. Consultant/Architect, Spherion Technology Services, Microsoft MVP “There is no shortage of VB .NET books in the market, but this is the only book straight from the creators. While that is an excellent reason in itself for reading this book, it is the brevity and clarity of the content, along with the examples, that makes this book a must-have.” —Amit Kalani, Developer “Overall, I liked this book and it definitely benefited me. I learned new things I didn’t see anywhere else and I’ll certainly put these to good use in the future. Paul’s book makes a great reference manual for intermediate and advanced VB .NET developers.” —Philip Williams, System Engineer, LDC Direct “This book contains a lot of great information I have seen nowhere else and addresses issues that other books do not.” —Ethan Roberts, .NET Architect, General Casualty “This book is full of useful information and provides a good historical background for the Visual Basic .NET Language.” —Dave Vitter, Technical Lead Developer and author of Designing Visual Basic .NET Applications (Coriolis, 2001) The definitive Microsoft Visual Basic .NET reference—authored by Visual Basic .NET’s lead architect If you want to leverage all of VB .NET’s immense power, get this book. It’s the definitive VB .NET reference and tutorial, and the first Visual Basic book written by one of VB .NET’s lead architects. No other book offers this much behind-the-scenes insight about why VB .NET works the way it does, how it evolved, and how you can make the most of it. The Visual Basic .NET Programming Language is a superb learning tool for new VB .NET programmers and a must-have reference for developers at every level. Paul Vick presents precise language descriptions, essential reference materials, practical insights, and hundreds of code samples, straight from Microsoft’s VB .NET design team. Just some of the features include: A history and overview of Visual Basic’s evolution into VB .NET Complete coverage of the language syntax Transitioning from COM to the CLR and leveraging the .NET platform Runtime functions Taking full advantage of VB .NET’s object-oriented features Notes on style, design, and compatibility throughout the text Notes for the advanced user throughout the text Vick exposes VB .NET’s most powerful capabilities with unprecedented depth and clarity, and packs this book with information you simply won’t find anywhere else. Whether you’re an experienced VB .NET programmer, upgrading from earlier versions of Visual Basic, or coming to Visual Basic and .NET for the first time, you’ll find this book indispensable.","publisher":"Addison-Wesley Professional","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ejzRTF2TL6UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":407,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":2,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ejzRTF2TL6UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=visual+basic,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781419628955","title":"Visual Basic 6 Made Easy: A Complete Tutorial for Beginners","author":"Liew Voon Kiong","publish_date":"2006-01-05","description":"Visual Basic(r) 6 made easy is written by the author of the popular online Visual Basic tutorial at www.vbtutor.net.

Also covered are instructions for how to greatly increase your graphics capabilities using transformations, which allow you to move, stretch, or rotate graphics. They also let you work in coordinate systems that make sense for your application. The author also describes techniques for using the above in printouts, describing the sequence of events that produce a printout and show how to generate and preview printouts, with examples which show how to wrap long chunks of text across multiple pages, if necessary. In addition, you will learn about two powerful new graphic tools that were introduced with .NET Framework 3.0: WPF graphics and FlowDocuments. XAML graphic commands allow a WPF application to draw and fill the same kinds of shapes that a program can draw by using graphics objects. Finally, a discussion on the FlowDocument object shows you how to define items that should be flowed across multiple pages as space permits. This lets you display text, graphics, controls, and other items that automatically flow across page breaks. FlowDocument viewers make displaying these documents easy for you, and simplifies the user's reading of the documents. This Wrox Blox also contains 35 example programs written in Visual Basic 2008, although most of the code works in previous versions of Visual Basic .NET as well. The most notable exceptions are WPF graphics and FlowDocuments, both of which require WPF provided in .NET Framework 3.0 and later.","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IQHYdVPF82AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":146,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IQHYdVPF82AC&dq=visual+basic,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IQHYdVPF82AC&printsec=frontcover&dq=visual+basic,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=16&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780672322471","title":"Database Programming with Visual Basic .

Dale, Michael McMillan","publish_date":"2002","description":"Visual Basic .NET: A Laboratory Course teaches the reader how to program in Visual Basic from an object-oriented viewpoint, which is important because of the object-oriented flavor of VB.NET. The emphasis of this book is not on the fancy users interface tricks you can perform with VB.NET, but on the fundamentals of writing correct and efficient VB programs. The book provides a number of example programs that illustrate the concepts developed in the text, and the exercises at the end of each chapter help to reinforce the expository material from the chapter. Visual Basic is arguably the most popular computer programming language for application development in the United States and around the world today. Visual Basic is also an excellent language to teach as a \"first\" computer language because of its easy-to-learn syntax and flexibility. This book treats Visual Basic as a serious programming language and not as just another Windows application. One concern that is frequently voiced when discussing the differences between Visual Basic and C+++ is the level of object-oriented programming supported by Visual Basic. With the upcoming release of VB.net, the language will support all the major features of object-oriented programming- encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.","publisher":"Jones & Bartlett Learning","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DfLq0eSO9UUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":269,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DfLq0eSO9UUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=visual+basic,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=39&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780672310546","title":"Peter Norton's Guide to Visual Basic 6","author":"Peter Norton, Michael Groh","publish_date":"1998","description":"Provides step-by-step instructions on using Visual Basic 6 for object-oriented programming, database programming, and Internet programming","publisher":"Sams Publishing","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hrd5kHr8MdYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":790,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hrd5kHr8MdYC&q=visual+basic,+subject:computers&dq=visual+basic,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780078825088","title":"Visual Basic 6 from the Ground Up","author":"Gary Cornell","publish_date":"1998-09-01","description":"This text enables readers to produce commercial-quality programs for practical application, and includes a section devoted to programming concepts for the novice as well as a section aimed at the more advanced user.","publisher":"McGraw Hill Professional","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8owWwE0DZlUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":932,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":3.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8owWwE0DZlUC&q=visual+basic,+subject:computers&dq=visual+basic,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=41&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780782152531","title":"Mastering Visual Basic .NET Database Programming","author":"Evangelos Petroutsos, Asli Bilgin","publish_date":"2006-02-20","description":"Enter a New World of Database Programming Visual Basic .NET and ADO.NET facilitate the development of a new generation of database applications, including disconnected applications that run on the Web.

As of March 2005, Microsoft no longer supports this version of Visual Basic. And you can't blame them. Three years ago, they introduced the .NET Framework--an elegant, powerful platform--along with the new component-based VB.NET language. But roughly five million of you decided to stick with VB6, mostly to maintain legacy Windows and COM projects. Now, with the upcoming release of VB 2005, Microsoft has several attractive reasons to upgrade that you'll find hard to resist, including the return of some VB6 features. And we have the perfect book to help you make the conversion: Visual Basic 2005 Jumpstart. Now, you can test-drive the beta version of VB 2005 with three hands-on projects that enable you to learn the syntax of this new language quickly. VB 2005 not only lets you convert the bulk of your existing VB6 code, but offers several familiar features, such as compile-and-run debugging, new MyClasses that simplify use of .NET libraries and frameworks, lots of IDE support for Windows, web and mobile GUI development, and data access controls that closely resemble what you use now. The real plus is that you'll be using these features with the .NET platform, which is more secure, less complex than COM, and offers OneClick deployment. Visual Basic 2005 Jumpstart lets you get the feel of this platform for building smart/rich Windows Forms clients, ASP.NET web applications, and web services. Author Wei-Meng Lee, a Microsoft .NET MVP, veteran O'Reilly author and frequent contributor to the O'Reilly Network, has put together three useful test-drive projects, complete with code samples, that let you develop: A personal library Windows application A Web-based shopping cart application A stock enquiry Web Service Our jumpstart guide is the quick, painless way to migrate from VB6 to VB 2005, and the perfect training manual for moving your organization to the more robust, dynamic and secure world of .NET.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fTs_pppg5PoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":216,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fTs_pppg5PoC&dq=visual+basic,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fTs_pppg5PoC&pg=PA29&dq=visual+basic,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=104&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780071800037","title":"CATIA V5: Macro Programming with Visual Basic Script","author":"Dieter Ziethen","publish_date":"2013-04-05","description":"Write powerful, custom macros for CATIA V5 CATIA V5 Macro Programming with Visual Basic Script shows you, step by step, how to create your own macros that automate repetitive tasks, accelerate design procedures, and automatically generate complex geometries.

Targeted at programmers with some prior programming experience, the book covers the major areas of application development for Microsoft's new .NET platform. After starting with the traditional \"hello world\" application, the book discusses the two basic building blocks of any .NET application built with Visual Basic--the Visual Basic .NET programming language and the .NET Framework. Topics covered include: Visual Basic language elements Visual Basic's object-oriented language features Programming with attributes The Common Language Runtime Garbage Collection and the Finalize and Dispose methods Programmatically reading from and writing to .NET configuration files The remainder of the book focuses on the three major kinds of applications that can be developed with the .NET Framework: Windows Forms applications, ASP.NET applications, and web services. In each case, the book shows you how to build an application using Visual Studio .NET as well as using a text editor and the Visual Basic command-line compiler. This gives you an \"under the hood\" look at what Visual Studio is doing and allows you to gain a greater understanding of how a .NET application works--an understanding that you can take advantage of in building your own applications. Individual development topics covered in these chapters include: Developing Multiple Document Interface (MDI) Windows Forms applications. Handling form and control placement and resizing Working with Windows Forms menus Working with Windows Common Dialogs Taking advantage of .NET printer services programmatically Using ASP.NET HTML controls and Web controls Understanding security in ASP.NET Creating, discovering, and consuming web services Accessing data in your .NET applications using ADO.NET Published just in time for the first release of Visual Studio .NET,Programming Visual Basic .NETis sure to become a key component of developers' .NET libraries.","publisher":"Oreilly & Associates Incorporated","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LYxQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":446,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LYxQAAAAMAAJ&q=visual+basic,+subject:computers&dq=visual+basic,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=113&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780130933829","title":"Application Development Using Visual Basic and .NET","author":"Robert J.

Millions of others, however, continued to stick with Visual Basic 6. They weren't ready for such a radical change, which included an object-oriented environment similar to Java. They liked the old Visual Basic just fine.In an effort to win over those diehard VB6 developers, the company has included a new version of VB.NET in its upcoming next generation release of the Visual Studio .NET development platform. Visual Basic 2005 comes with innovative language constructs, new compiler features, dramatically enhanced productivity and an improved debugging experience. The language's new version is now available in beta release, and Microsoft is encouraging developers to give it a test drive.Visual Basic 2005: A Developer's Notebook provides the ideal test track. With nearly 50 hands-on projects, this practical introduction to VB 2005 will bring you up to speed on all the new features of this language by allowing you to work with them directly. The book summarizes the changes that VB 2005 brings, and tells you how to acquire, install and configure the beta version of VB 2005 SDK. Each project or experiment explores a different feature, with emphasis on changes that can increase productivity, simplify programming tasks, and help you add new functionality to your applications.This one-of-a-kind book also offers suggestions for further experimentation, links to on-line documentation and other sources of information, and practical notes and warnings from the author.The new Developer's Notebooks series from O'Reilly offers an in-depth first look at important new tools for software developers. Emphasizing example over explanation and practice over theory, they focus on learning by doing you'll get the goods straight from the masters, in an informal and code-intensive style. For those who want to get up speed with VB 2005 right away, this is the perfect all lab, no lecture guide.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Wvvo9lEYAfkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":264,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Wvvo9lEYAfkC&dq=visual+basic,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Wvvo9lEYAfkC&pg=PA43&dq=visual+basic,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=116&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780672302596","title":"Do it yourself Visual BASIC for Windows: ","author":"William J.

Windows is a message-based system. Every action you request creates one or more messages to carry out the action. These messages are passed between objects and carry with them information that gives the recipient more detail on how to interpret and act upon the message. With Subclassing and the Windows hooking mechanism (\"hooks\"), you can manipulate, modify, or even discard messages bound for other objects within the operating system, in the process changing the way the system behaves. What kinds of results can you achieve using the power of subclassing and hooking? Here are just a few of the possibilities: Determine when a window is being activated or deactivated and respond to this change. Display descriptions of menu items as the mouse moves across them. Disallow a user to move or resize a window. Determine where the mouse cursor is and respond accordingly. Determine when the display resolution has been changed. Monitor the system for a low system resource condition. Modify or disallow keystrokes sent to a window or a control. Create an automated testing application. Determine when an application is idle. Along with this power comes responsibility; Windows is very unforgiving if subclassing and hooking are used incorrectly. Subclassing & Hooking with Visual Basic demonstrates the various techniques for intercepting messages bound for one or more windows or controls: the intercepted message can be left in its original state or modified; afterwards, the message can be sent to its original destination or discarded. For both VB 6 and VB.NET developers, Subclassing & Hooking with Visual Basic opens up a wealth of possibilities that ordinarily would be completely unavailable, or at least not easy to implement.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KzYGnddT3FMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":685,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KzYGnddT3FMC&pg=PA107&dq=visual+basic,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=121&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"Visual Basic Answers!","author":"Michael Otey","publish_date":"1999-01-01","description":"A troubleshooting guide for expert users examines the fundamental concepts of the programming language and explains how to enhance programs, add subroutines, and utilize events, variables, and arrays","publisher":"McGraw-Hill Osborne Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r4xQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":574,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r4xQAAAAMAAJ&q=visual+basic,+subject:computers&dq=visual+basic,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=122&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780538468480","title":"Microsoft Visual Basic 2010 for Windows, Web, and Office Applications: Complete","author":"Gary Shelly, Corinne Hoisington","publish_date":"2010-08-30","description":"MICROSOFT VISUAL BASIC 2010: COMPLETE teaches students the essentials of computer programming using the latest Visual Basic programming language, Visual Basic 2010.

However, even experienced web programmers will greatly benefit from the authors' thorough coverage of the ASP.NET namespaces and their clear coverage of the ADO.NET classes most important to Web applications that use relational databases for data storage. All developers will benefit from the authors' extensive practical advice (based on their unique professional backgrounds) about how to produce create high-quality code and how to create professional, usable websites.

It's not a primer on the language, and it won't dull your brain with arguments hyping .NET either. Its goal, rather, is to make you immediately productive, creating Windows and Web applications using Visual Basic 2005 and Visual Studio 2005. Written for VB6 and novice programmers, the book shows how Visual Basic 2005 can be used to rapidly build modern Windows and web applications. What makes this book different is what's not included. There's no introduction to Visual Basic, no explanation of how it fits into the .NET world. Why waste time reading about something you'll learn for yourself as soon as you start creating applications? You won't even write a \"Hello World\" program. With Programming Visual Basic 2005 you'll get started building something meaningful, right away. The book is divided into three parts--Building Windows Applications, Building Web Applications, and Programming with Visual Basic--each of which could be a book on its own. The author shares his thorough understanding of the subject matter through lucid explanations and intelligently designed lessons that guide you to increasing levels of expertise. By the time you've finished the book, you'll know how to program both Windows and web applications with VB 2005. The support for this book extends beyond its covers. Jesse offers a FAQ, Errata, complete source code and a link to a free private support discussion center on his web site: LibertyAssociates.com - just click on books. Jesse Liberty, Microsoft .NET MVP, is the best-selling author of O'Reilly Media's Programming ASP.NET and over a dozen other books on web and object-oriented programming. Jesse is a frequent contributor to many industry publications and websites, and has spoken at numerous industry events. He is a former Distinguished Software Engineer at AT&T and Vice President for technology development at CitiBank. Jesse Liberty's books have successfully guided thousands of programmers into the world of .NET programming, and Programming Visual Basic 2005 is no exception.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QZpyXWpN5IQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":576,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QZpyXWpN5IQC&dq=visual+basic,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QZpyXWpN5IQC&pg=PT375&dq=visual+basic,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=195&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781430207665","title":"Expert One-on-One Visual Basic .NET Business Objects","author":"Rockford Lhotka","publish_date":"2008-01-01","description":"Popular conference speaker \"Rocky\" Lhotka shows how to use the framework to create a sample application and demonstrates how easy it is to write Windows, Web, and Web services interfaces for applications based on it.","publisher":"Apress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qCPB56PHHYIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":702,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qCPB56PHHYIC&dq=visual+basic,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qCPB56PHHYIC&pg=PP5&dq=visual+basic,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=196&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780471755555","title":"Wrox's Visual Basic 2005 Express Edition Starter Kit","author":"Andrew Parsons","publish_date":"2005-12-12","description":null,"publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wI88u24r3w0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":358,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wI88u24r3w0C&pg=PA18&dq=visual+basic,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=197&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780596002008","title":"Programming Visual Basic for Palm OS","author":"Matthew Holmes, Patrick Burton, Roger Knoell","publish_date":"2002","description":"Explains how to use Visual Basic to design and code applications for Palm-compatible devices, covering data migration, SQL, wireless Web programs, and security.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=a_IcC0295GYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":406,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a_IcC0295GYC&pg=PR3&dq=visual+basic,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=198&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780557487035","title":"Visual Basic Programming for Kids","author":"Timothy Busbice","publish_date":"2010-06","description":"This book is designed to teach Visual Basic programming to preteen kids with a hands-on approach and a step by step teaching style.

Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET) is an object-oriented computer programming language. It is an extension of the BASIC programming language that combines BASIC functions and commands with visual controls. Visual Basic provides a graphical user interface GUI that allows the developer to drag and drop objects into the program as well as manually write program code. Visual Basic is designed to make software development easy and efficient, while still being powerful enough to create advanced programs. For example, the Visual Basic language is designed to be \"human readable,\" which means the source code can be understood without requiring lots of comments. Programs created with Visual Basic can be designed to run on Windows, on the Web, within Office applications, or on mobile devices. Visual Studio .NET provides development tools to create programs based on the .NET framework, such as ASP.NET applications, which are often deployed on the Web.","publisher":"Course Technology Ptr","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t4ULAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":799,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t4ULAAAACAAJ&dq=visual+basic,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=368&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780071345347","title":"Visual Basic 6 Bootcamp All-in-one Certification Exam Guide","author":"","publish_date":"1999-01","description":"Expertly designed for easy comprehension and retention, this full-immersion study guide delivers the essentials you need to confidently:","publisher":"McGraw-Hill Osborne Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KULQWBxhlIwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":665,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KULQWBxhlIwC&q=visual+basic,+subject:computers&dq=visual+basic,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=369&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780471481010","title":"VB .NET in 60 Minutes a Day","author":"Bruce Barstow, Tony Martin","publish_date":"2003-10-13","description":"Professional Visual Basic .NET skills are in heavy demand since it's often the easiest and fastest way to connect the many components that are required in an enterprise-level application Includes thirty one-hour lessons that recreate a typical week-long introductory seminar Covers the critical information that every VB .NET developer should know The author has written more than thirty courses in application development, messaging, and network development and is currently training for AutoDesk Companion Web site features an online presentation by the author that follows along with each chapter and includes an audio-only option for readers with dial-up Internet connection","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BkP1NpMWBt4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":720,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BkP1NpMWBt4C&dq=visual+basic,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BkP1NpMWBt4C&pg=PA30&dq=visual+basic,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=370&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781883884420","title":"7 Client/Server Applications in Visual Basic","author":"Mark McCall","publish_date":"1997-01-01","description":"Imagine building an addition to your home with all the tools and materials you need right at hand, and, better yet, the framing already in place!

Bug Alert Description: Changing the startup form's name in a VB WinForms app does not update the \"Startup form\" #4517 Explanation: In the latest Visual Basic update on GitHub, Microsoft accidentally introduced a significant bug that you should be aware of. In the Visual Basic project properties dialog on one of the tabs (Application), is a drop down box for selecting the \"startup object\". This can be either a Main method or a System.Windows.Forms instance (or System.Windows.Window for WPF). When you do a rename on a form (say from the code editor in source or from the solution explorer) currently set as the startup form the rename doesn't cascade to the startup object project property cause the project to enter an invalid state where the user must now manually reset this project property from the now nonexistent Form to the new name. This is a huge annoyance.

SQL Server is now the first choice for the Visual Basic developer who wants a more powerful, reliable, and sophisticated database than Microsoft Access can provide. SQL Server 2000 is tightly integrated with Windows 2000, offering more support for XML and much improved Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) services. This book is for Visual Basic developers who want to integrate SQL Server 2000 into their applications. It covers everything you need to know to work with SQL Server 2000 and provide users of your Visual Basic and web-based applications with controlled access to your data. You'll start with an introduction to designing and creating a database and then move on to create increasingly complex T-SQL stored procedures.

Pro VB 2010 and the .NET 4.0 Platform provides developers with a complete guide to the new technology, explaining the importance of all the key VB 2010 language features. This edition has been comprehensively revised and rewritten to make it accurately reflect the VB 10 language specification for the .NET 4.0 platform. You’ll find new chapters covering the important concepts of dynamic lookups, named and optional arguments, Parallel LINQ (PLINQ), improved COM interop, and variance for generics. The first edition of this book was released at the 2001 Tech-Ed conference in Atlanta, Georgia. At that time, the .NET platform was still a beta product, and in many ways, so was this book. This is not to say that the early editions of this text did not have merit—after all, the book was a 2002 Jolt Award finalist and it won the 2003 Referenceware Excellence Award. However, over the years that author Andrew Troelsen spent working with the common language runtime (CLR), he gained a much deeper understanding of the .NET platform and the subtleties of the VB programming language, and he feels that this sixth edition of the book is as close to a “final release” as he’s come yet! If you’re checking out this book for the first time, do understand that it’s targeted at experienced software professionals and/or graduate students of computer science (so don’t expect three chapters on iteration or decision constructs!). The mission of this text is to provide you with a rock-solid foundation in the VB programming language and the core aspects of the .NET platform (assemblies, remoting, Windows Forms, Web Forms, ADO.NET, XML web services, etc.). Once you digest the information presented in these 25 chapters, you’ll be in a perfect position to apply this knowledge to your specific programming assignments and explore the .NET universe on your own terms. What you’ll learn Discover the ins and outs of the leading .NET technology. Learn from an award-winning author who has been teaching the .NET world since version 1.0. Find complete coverage of the WPF, WCF, and WF foundations that support the core .NET platform. Who this book is for This book is for anyone with some software development experience who is interested in the new .NET Framework 4.0 and the VB language. Whether you are moving to .NET for the first time or are already writing applications on .NET 2.0 or .NET 3.5, this book will provide you with a comprehensive grounding in the new technology and serve as a complete reference throughout your coding career.
