[{"isbn":"9780133522853","title":"The C++ Programming Language","author":"Bjarne Stroustrup","publish_date":"2013-07-10","description":"The new C++11 standard allows programmers to express ideas more clearly, simply, and directly, and to write faster, more efficient code. Bjarne Stroustrup, the designer and original implementer of C++, has reorganized, extended, and completely rewritten his definitive reference and tutorial for programmers who want to use C++ most effectively. The C++ Programming Language, Fourth Edition, delivers meticulous, richly explained, and integrated coverage of the entire language—its facilities, abstraction mechanisms, standard libraries, and key design techniques. Throughout, Stroustrup presents concise, “pure C++11” examples, which have been carefully crafted to clarify both usage and program design. To promote deeper understanding, the author provides extensive cross-references, both within the book and to the ISO standard. New C++11 coverage includes Support for concurrency Regular expressions, resource management pointers, random numbers, and improved containers General and uniform initialization, simplified for-statements, move semantics, and Unicode support Lambdas, general constant expressions, control over class defaults, variadic templates, template aliases, and user-defined literals Compatibility issues Topics addressed in this comprehensive book include Basic facilities: type, object, scope, storage, computation fundamentals, and more Modularity, as supported by namespaces, source files, and exception handling C++ abstraction, including classes, class hierarchies, and templates in support of a synthesis of traditional programming, object-oriented programming, and generic programming Standard Library: containers, algorithms, iterators, utilities, strings, stream I/O, locales, numerics, and more The C++ basic memory model, in depth This fourth edition makes C++11 thoroughly accessible to programmers moving from C++98 or other languages, while introducing insights and techniques that even cutting-edge C++11 programmers will find indispensable. This book features an enhanced, layflat binding, which allows the book to stay open more easily when placed on a flat surface. This special binding method—noticeable by a small space inside the spine—also increases durability.","publisher":"Addison-Wesley","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PSUNAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":1363,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PSUNAAAAQBAJ&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":48,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PSUNAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780521750349","title":"Numerical Recipes Example Book (C++): The Art of Scientific Computing","author":"William T.

It is an absolute must-read for anyone thinking of doing serious C++ development. If you’ve never read Effective C++ and you think you know everything about C++, think again.” — Steve Schirripa, Software Engineer, Google “C++ and the C++ community have grown up in the last fifteen years, and the third edition of Effective C++ reflects this. The clear and precise style of the book is evidence of Scott’s deep insight and distinctive ability to impart knowledge.” — Gerhard Kreuzer, Research and Development Engineer, Siemens AG The first two editions of Effective C++ were embraced by hundreds of thousands of programmers worldwide. The reason is clear: Scott Meyers’ practical approach to C++ describes the rules of thumb used by the experts — the things they almost always do or almost always avoid doing — to produce clear, correct, efficient code. The book is organized around 55 specific guidelines, each of which describes a way to write better C++. Each is backed by concrete examples. For this third edition, more than half the content is new, including added chapters on managing resources and using templates. Topics from the second edition have been extensively revised to reflect modern design considerations, including exceptions, design patterns, and multithreading. Important features of Effective C++ include: Expert guidance on the design of effective classes, functions, templates, and inheritance hierarchies. Applications of new “TR1” standard library functionality, along with comparisons to existing standard library components. Insights into differences between C++ and other languages (e.g., Java, C#, C) that help developers from those languages assimilate “the C++ way” of doing things.","publisher":"Pearson Education","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Qx5oyB49poYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":318,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Qx5oyB49poYC&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":4.5,"ratings_count":48,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Qx5oyB49poYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=14&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780763718176","title":"A Complete Guide to Programming in C++","author":"Ulla Kirch-Prinz, Peter Prinz","publish_date":"2002","description":"A Complete Guide to Programming in C++ was written for both students interested in learning the C++ programming language from scratch, and for advanced C++ programmers wishing to enhance their knowledge of C++.The chapters are organized to guide the reader from elementary language concepts to professional software development, with in-depth coverage of all the C++ language elements 'en route.'

It will enable those with moderate programming experience to select a neural network model appropriate to solving a particular problem, and to produce a working program implementing that network. The book provides guidance along the entire problem-solving path, including designing the training set, preprocessing variables, training and validating the network, and evaluating its performance. Though the book is not intended as a general course in neural networks, no background in neural works is assumed and all models are presented from the ground up. The principle focus of the book is the three layer feedforward network, for more than a decade as the workhorse of professional arsenals. Other network models with strong performance records are also included. Bound in the book is an IBM diskette that includes the source code for all programs in the book. Much of this code can be easily adapted to C compilers. In addition, the operation of all programs is thoroughly discussed both in the text and in the comments within the code to facilitate translation to other languages.","publisher":"Morgan Kaufmann","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7Ez_Pq0sp2EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":493,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":4.5,"ratings_count":4,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7Ez_Pq0sp2EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780763725624","title":"Applied Data Structures with C++","author":"Peter Smith","publish_date":"2004","description":"Data Structures & Theory of Computation","publisher":"Jones & Bartlett Learning","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HJ9gds_zhVEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":692,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":3.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HJ9gds_zhVEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780132654425","title":"C++ Coding Standards: 101 Rules, Guidelines, and Best Practices","author":"Herb Sutter, Andrei Alexandrescu","publish_date":"2004-10-25","description":"Consistent, high-quality coding standards improve software quality, reduce time-to-market, promote teamwork, eliminate time wasted on inconsequential matters, and simplify maintenance. Now, two of the world's most respected C++ experts distill the rich collective experience of the global C++ community into a set of coding standards that every developer and development team can understand and use as a basis for their own coding standards. The authors cover virtually every facet of C++ programming: design and coding style, functions, operators, class design, inheritance, construction/destruction, copying, assignment, namespaces, modules, templates, genericity, exceptions, STL containers and algorithms, and more. Each standard is described concisely, with practical examples. From type definition to error handling, this book presents C++ best practices, including some that have only recently been identified and standardized-techniques you may not know even if you've used C++ for years. Along the way, you'll find answers to questions like What's worth standardizing--and what isn't? What are the best ways to code for scalability? What are the elements of a rational error handling policy? How (and why) do you avoid unnecessary initialization, cyclic, and definitional dependencies? When (and how) should you use static and dynamic polymorphism together? How do you practice \"safe\" overriding? When should you provide a no-fail swap? Why and how should you prevent exceptions from propagating across module boundaries? Why shouldn't you write namespace declarations or directives in a header file? Why should you use STL vector and string instead of arrays? How do you choose the right STL search or sort algorithm? What rules should you follow to ensure type-safe code? Whether you're working alone or with others, C++ Coding Standards will help you write cleaner code--and write it faster, with fewer hassles and less frustration.","publisher":"Pearson Education","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mmjVIC6WolgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":240,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mmjVIC6WolgC&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mmjVIC6WolgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=25&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781565923546","title":"Programming Embedded Systems in C and C++","author":"Michael Barr","publish_date":"1999","description":"An introduction to embedding systems for C and C++++ programmers encompasses such topics as testing memory devices, writing and erasing Flash memory, verifying nonvolatile memory contents, and much more.

Complete albums are now being recorded and engineered \"inside the box\"-all within a computer without hardware processing or mixing gear. Audio effect plug-ins, which are small software modules that work within audio host applications, like Avid Pro Tools, Apple Logic, Ableton Live, and Steinberg Cubase, are big business. Designing Audio Effect Plug-Ins in C++ gives readers everything they need to know to create real-world, working plug-ins in the widely used C++ programming language. Beginning with the necessary theory behind audio signal processing, author Will Pirkle quickly gets into the heart of this implementation guide, with clearly-presented, previously unpublished algorithms, tons of example code, and practical advice. From the companion website, readers can download free software for the rapid development of the algorithms, many of which have never been revealed to the general public.

They regard C++ as inherently slow and inappropriate for performance-critical applications. Consequently, C++ has had little success penetrating domains such as networking, operating system kernels, device drivers, and others. \"Efficient C++\" explodes that myth. Written by two authors with first-hand experience wringing the last ounce of performance from commercial C++ applications, this book demonstrates the potential of C++ to produce highly efficient programs. The book reveals practical, everyday object-oriented design principles and C++ coding techniques that can yield large performance improvements. It points out common pitfalls in both design and code that generate hidden operating costs. This book focuses on combining C++'s power and flexibility with high performance and scalability, resulting in the best of both worlds. Specific topics include temporary objects, memory management, templates, inheritance, virtual functions, inlining, reference-counting, STL, and much more.

This is a practical guide to the application of artificial neural networks. Geared toward the practitioner, Pattern Recognition with Neural Networks in C++ covers pattern classification and neural network approaches within the same framework. Through the book's presentation of underlying theory and numerous practical examples, readers gain an understanding that will allow them to make judicious design choices rendering neural application predictable and effective. The book provides an intuitive explanation of each method for each network paradigm. This discussion is supported by a rigorous mathematical approach where necessary. C++ has emerged as a rich and descriptive means by which concepts, models, or algorithms can be precisely described. For many of the neural network models discussed, C++ programs are presented for the actual implementation. Pictorial diagrams and in-depth discussions explain each topic. Necessary derivative steps for the mathematical models are included so that readers can incorporate new ideas into their programs as the field advances with new developments. For each approach, the authors clearly state the known theoretical results, the known tendencies of the approach, and their recommendations for getting the best results from the method. The material covered in the book is accessible to working engineers with little or no explicit background in neural networks. However, the material is presented in sufficient depth so that those with prior knowledge will find this book beneficial. Pattern Recognition with Neural Networks in C++ is also suitable for courses in neural networks at an advanced undergraduate or graduate level. This book is valuable for academic as well as practical research.","publisher":"CRC Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t--zfAxpQGIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":432,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":2,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t--zfAxpQGIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=57&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780672334054","title":"C++ Templates: The Complete Guide, Portable Documents","author":"David Vandevoorde, Nicolai M.

IOStreams and locales are two such major components for text internationalization. As critical as these two APIs are, however, there are few resources devoted to explaining them. \"Standard C++ IOStreams and Locales\" fills this informational gap. It provides a comprehensive description of, and reference to, the iostreams and locales classes, showing how to put them to use and offering advanced information on customizing and extending their basic operation. Written by two experts involved with the development of the standard, this book reveals the rationale behind the design of the APIs and points out their potential pitfalls. This book serves as both a guide and a reference to C++ components. Part I explains iostreams, what they are, how they are used, their underlying architectural concepts, and the techniques for extending the iostream framework. Part II introduces internationalization and shows you how to adapt your program to local conventions. Readers seeking an initial overview of the problem domain will find an explanation of what internationalization and localization are, how they are related, and how they differ. With examples, the authors show the differences among cultural conventions, how C++ locales can be used to address such differences, and how locale framework can be extended to handle further, nonstandard cultural conventions. \"Standard C++ IOStreams and Locales\" Explains formatting and error indication features of iostreams in detail Describes underlying concepts of the iostreams framework Demonstrates implementation of i/o operations for user-defined types Shows techniques for implementing extended stream and stream buffer classes Introduces internationalization Explains how to use standard features for internationalization Demonstrates techniques for implementation of user-defined internationalization services IOStreams and locales serve as a foundation library that provides a number of ready-to-use interfaces, as well as frameworks that can be customized and extended. The class reference to C++ IOStreams and locales completes this comprehensive resource, which belongs in the libraries of all intermediate and advanced C++ programmers. 0201183951B04062001","publisher":"Addison-Wesley Professional","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5qybChHSk7QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":640,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":3,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5qybChHSk7QC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=71&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781136423000","title":"C++ Programming Made Simple","author":"Conor Sexton","publish_date":"2012-05-16","description":"The author enables novices to get to grips with the programming language quickly and efficiently, and demystifies the subject matter making it easy to understand.

The material presented includes a treatment of elementary data structures such as arrays, lists, stacks, and trees, as well as newer structures that have emerged to support the process ing of multidimensional or spatial data files. These newer structures and algorithms have received increasing attention in recent years in conjunc tion with the rapid growth in computer-aided design, computer graphics, and related fields in which multidimensional data structures are of great interest. Our main objective is to mesh the underlying concepts with application examples that are of practical use and are timely in their implementations. To this end, we have used mainly the Abstract Data Structure (or Abstract Data Type (ADT)) approach to define structures for data and operations. Object-oriented programming (OOP) methodologies are employed to im plement these ADT concepts. In OOP, data and operations for an ADT are combined into a single entity (object). ADTs are used to specifiy the objects-arrays, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. OOP allows the pro grammer to more closely mimic the real-world applications. This OOP is more structured and modular than previous attempts. OOP has become de facto state-of-the-art in the 1990s.","publisher":"Springer","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ASbjBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":708,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ASbjBwAAQBAJ&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ASbjBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA13&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=80&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780763723873","title":"Foundations of Algorithms Using C++ Pseudocode","author":"Richard E.

It is divided into three parts plus several appendices. Part I provides a foundation for real-time C++ by covering language technologies, including object-oriented methods, template programming and optimization. Next, part II presents detailed descriptions of a variety of C++ components that are widely used in microcontroller programming. It details some of C++’s most powerful language elements, such as class types, templates and the STL, to develop components for microcontroller register access, low-level drivers, custom memory management, embedded containers, multitasking, etc. Finally, part III describes mathematical methods and generic utilities that can be employed to solve recurring problems in real-time C++. The appendices include a brief C++ language tutorial, information on the real-time C++ development environment and instructions for building GNU GCC cross-compilers and a microcontroller circuit. For this second edition, the most recent specification of C++14 in ISO/IEC 14882:2014 is used throughout the text. Several sections on new C++14 functionality have been added, and various others reworked to reflect changes in the standard. Also two new sample projects are introduced, and various user suggestions have been incorporated. To facilitate portability, no libraries other than those specified in the language standard itself are used. Efficiency is always in focus and numerous examples are backed up with real-time performance measurements and size analyses that quantify the true costs of the code down to the very last byte and microsecond. The target audience of this book mainly consists of students and professionals interested in real-time C++. Readers should be familiar with C or another programming language and will benefit most if they have had some previous experience with microcontroller electronics and the performance and size issues prevalent in embedded systems programming.","publisher":"Springer","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3sEDCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":378,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3sEDCwAAQBAJ&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3sEDCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=85&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780071469968","title":"C++ Demystified","author":"Jeff Kent","publish_date":"2004-05-17","description":"Minimal technical jargon, step-by-step discussions, and quizzes at the end of each chapter make this an easy-to-understand guide to C++ programming.

In response to this, Statistical Computing in C++ and R concentrates on the writing of code rather than the development and study of numerical algorithms per se. The book discusses code development in C++ and R and the use of these symbiotic languages in unison. It emphasizes that each offers distinct features that, when used in tandem, can take code writing beyond what can be obtained from either language alone. The text begins with some basics of object-oriented languages, followed by a \"boot-camp\" on the use of C++ and R. The authors then discuss code development for the solution of specific computational problems that are relevant to statistics including optimization, numerical linear algebra, and random number generation. Later chapters introduce abstract data structures (ADTs) and parallel computing concepts. The appendices cover R and UNIX Shell programming.

A metaprogram is a program that generates or manipulates program code. Ever since generic programming was introduced to C++, programmers have discovered myriad \"template tricks\" for manipulating programs as they are compiled, effectively eliminating the barrier between program and metaprogram. While excitement among C++ experts about these capabilities has reached the community at large, their practical application remains out of reach for most programmers. This book explains what metaprogramming is and how it is best used. It provides the foundation you'll need to use the template metaprogramming effectively in your own work. This book is aimed at any programmer who is comfortable with idioms of the Standard Template Library (STL). C++ power-users will gain a new insight into their existing work and a new fluency in the domain of metaprogramming. Intermediate-level programmers who have learned a few advanced template techniques will see where these tricks fit in the big picture and will gain the conceptual foundation to use them with discipline. Programmers who have caught the scent of metaprogramming, but for whom it is still mysterious, will finally gain a clear understanding of how, when, and why it works. All readers will leave with a new tool of unprecedented power at their disposal—the Boost Metaprogramming Library.

To address this problem, we must improve the underlying strategies and techniques used to create our systems. Specifically, we must build security in from the start, rather than append it as an afterthought. That's the point of Secure Coding in C and C++. In careful detail, this book shows software developers how to build high-quality systems that are less vulnerable to costly and even catastrophic attack. It's a book that every developer should read before the start of any serious project.\" --Frank Abagnale, author, lecturer, and leading consultant on fraud prevention and secure documents Learn the Root Causes of Software Vulnerabilities and How to Avoid Them Commonly exploited software vulnerabilities are usually caused by avoidable software defects. Having analyzed nearly 18,000 vulnerability reports over the past ten years, the CERT/Coordination Center (CERT/CC) has determined that a relatively small number of root causes account for most of them. This book identifies and explains these causes and shows the steps that can be taken to prevent exploitation. Moreover, this book encourages programmers to adopt security best practices and develop a security mindset that can help protect software from tomorrow's attacks, not just today's. Drawing on the CERT/CC's reports and conclusions, Robert Seacord systematically identifies the program errors most likely to lead to security breaches, shows how they can be exploited, reviews the potential consequences, and presents secure alternatives. Coverage includes technical detail on how to Improve the overall security of any C/C++ application Thwart buffer overflows and stack-smashing attacks that exploit insecure string manipulation logic Avoid vulnerabilities and security flaws resulting from the incorrect use of dynamic memory management functions Eliminate integer-related problems: integer overflows, sign errors, and truncation errors Correctly use formatted output functions without introducing format-string vulnerabilities Avoid I/O vulnerabilities, including race conditions Secure Coding in C and C++ presents hundreds of examples of secure code, insecure code, and exploits, implemented for Windows and Linux.

Thinking in terms of objects is the natural way of thinking. The concept of object has existed in Science for centuries. More recently, objects were introduced in Computation, and object-oriented programming languages were created. Yet the concept of object is not routinely used when teaching Science, and the idea that objects can come alive in a computer has not yet been fully exploited.This book is Volume 2 of the multi-volume series \"Articulated Robot Mechanics and C++ Code\". Volume 1 is \"Vectors, Matrices and C++ Code\", published in 2004. Volumes to be published are \"Articulated Robot Dynamics and C++ Code\", and \"Articulated Robot Control and C++ Code\". More volumes may be added in the future.This book integrates advanced rigid body Kinematics with object-oriented concepts and the actual code implementing them. It is both a textbook and a software release, complete with software documentation and the mathematical background that supports the code. The source code is included by download and readers can use it for their own programming. The reader will need a basic knowledge of Physics, particularly Mechanics, and Algebra and Trigonometry. Familiarity with C++ is not required because a course on C++ is included in Volume 1. You should read this book if you are a developer who needs an advanced background in rigid body Kinematics, a student of Physics or Engineering who needs to learn C++, a scientist who needs to write advanced code but can't waste time developing the basics, or you just need ready-to-use C++ source code for your project.","publisher":"SciControls.com","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=i4r3BHI5FYAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":700,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i4r3BHI5FYAC&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i4r3BHI5FYAC&pg=PA57&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=127&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780072255126","title":"The Art of C++","author":"Herbert Schildt","publish_date":"2004","description":"Learn how to apply C++ to a wide array of sophisticated applications.

The book became an instant classic, winning the 1995Software Development Jolt ColaAward for best book of the year. Now, inThinking in C++, Volume I, Second Edition, Eckel has thoroughly rewritten his masterpiece to reflect all the changes introduced in C++ by the final ANSI/ISO C++ standard. Every page has been revisited and rethought, with many new examples and exercises throughout -- all with a single goal: to help you understand C++ \"down to the bare metal,\" so you can solve virtually any development problem you encounter. Eckel begins with a detailed look at objects and their rationale, then shows how C++ programs can be constructed from off-the-shelf object libraries. This edition includes a new, chapter-length overview of the C features that are used in C++ -- plus a new CD-ROM containing an outstanding C seminar that covers all the foundations developers need before they can truly take advantage of C++. Eckel next introduces key object-oriented techniques such as data abstraction and implementation hiding. He then walks through initialization and cleanup; function overloading and default arguments; constants; inline functions; name control; references and the copy constructor; operator overloading; and more. There are chapters on dynamic object creation; inheritance and composition; polymorphism and virtual functions, and templates. (Bonus coverage of string, templates, and the Standard Template Library, can be found at Eckel's web site.) Every chapter contains many modular, to-the-point examples, plus exercises based on Eckel's extensive experience teaching C++ seminars. Put simply, Eckel has made an outstanding book on C++ even better.

All three are finally available together in this eBook collection. Effective C++ has been embraced by hundreds of thousands of programmers worldwide. The reason is clear: Scott Meyers’s practical approach to C++ describes the rules of thumb used by the experts to produce clear, correct, efficient code. The book is organized around 55 specific guidelines, each of which describes a way to write better C++. Each is backed by concrete examples. In More Effective C++, Meyers presents 35 ways to improve your programs and designs. Drawing on years of experience, Meyers explains how to write software that is more effective: more efficient, more robust, more consistent, more portable, and more reusable. In short, how to write C++ software that’s just plain better. In Effective STL, Meyers goes beyond describing what's in the STL to show you how to use it. Each of the book’s 50 guidelines is backed by Meyers’s legendary analysis and incisive examples, so you’ll learn not only what to do, but also when to do it–and why. Together in this collection, these books include the following important features: Expert guidance on the design of effective classes, functions, templates, and inheritance hierarchies. Applications of new “TR1” standard library functionality, along with comparisons to existing standard library components. Insights into differences between C++ and other languages (e.g., Java, C#, C) that help developers from those languages assimilate “the C++ way” of doing things. Proven methods for improving program efficiency, including incisive examinations of the time/space costs of C++ language features Comprehensive descriptions of advanced techniques used by C++ experts, including placement new, virtual constructors, smart pointers, reference counting, proxy classes, and double-dispatching Examples of the profound impact of exception handling on the structure and behavior of C++ classes and functions Practical treatments of new language features, including bool, mutable, explicit, namespaces, member templates, the Standard Template Library, and more. If your compilers don’t yet support these features, Meyers shows you how to get the job done without them. Advice on choosing among standard STL containers (like vector and list), nonstandard STL containers (like hash_set and hash_map), and non-STL containers (like bitset). Techniques to maximize the efficiency of the STL and the programs that use it. Insights into the behavior of iterators, function objects, and allocators, including things you should not do. Guidance for the proper use of algorithms and member functions whose names are the same (e.g., find), but whose actions differ in subtle (but important) ways. Discussions of potential portability problems, including straightforward ways to avoid them.","publisher":"Addison-Wesley","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U7lTySXdFk0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":944,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U7lTySXdFk0C&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U7lTySXdFk0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=136&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781886411951","title":"How Not to Program in C++: 111 Broken Programs and 3 Working Ones, Or why Does 2+2","author":"Steve Oualline","publish_date":"2003","description":"Based on real-world errors, the 101 fun and challenging C++ puzzles in How Not to Program in C++ range from easy (one wrong character) to mind twisting (errors with multiple threads).

It is intended to be an introduction to Visual C++ for technical people including practicing engineers, engineering students, and others who would like to understand Windows programming and use its inherent graphic capabilities. While the book is aimed at a technical audience, the mathematical content is modest and it should be readable by most people interested in C++ programming. It introduces readers to Windows programming in a natural way, making use of the object-oriented environment, the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), and the document/view organization.Over fifty example projects are included on a companion CD. These example projects are used in the book's tutorial format initially by introducing Visual C++ programming and important C++ concepts. Then coverage of Windows programming begins with fundamental graphics operations including interactive drawing with mouse inputs. This is followed by program interaction through Windows tools for creating drop down menus, toolbar buttons, dialog windows, file input/output, output to printers, etc. Basic animation concepts are presented, using classes to develop, manipulate and display geometric shapes. Graphs are plotted as objects and the process of creating color contour plots is discussed.After using this book and following its collection of example programs, readers should be well prepared to write interactive programs which integrate Windows functionality and graphics with their own C++ programming. The step-by-step structure of each example in the book is described thoroughly and only standard Microsoft resources for graphics are required. Exercises at the end of each chapter provide opportunities to revisit and extend the tutorial examples. The project folders on the CD include complete program code for all examples. Files are also provided that contain classes and functions for handling geometric objects and graphs and which may be easily adapted for a wide variety of application programs.","publisher":"World Scientific","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oYE2Aa7dKTQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":338,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oYE2Aa7dKTQC&pg=PA1&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=144&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"Leaping from Basic to C++","author":"Robert J.

The significance of this for programmers is that it offers more flexibility allowing them to shift to object-oriented programming if and when they feel the need to do so. In this regard, C++ differs from some purely object-oriented languages, such as Smalltalk, Eiffel and Java. This book offers practical guidance on how to programme in both styles. The C++ language and its standard library have gone through a good many improvements and extensions during their evolution. This third edition has therefore been completely revised in accordance with the C++ language revision, which is embodied in the ANSI/ISO C++ Standard. For example, the new, important type string is used throughout the book and the Standard Template Library (STL) is introduced to readers at an early stage and discussed in more detail later on.

The ADAPTIVE Communication Environment (ACE) is an open-source toolkit for building high-performance networked applications and next-generation middleware. ACE's power and flexibility arise from object-oriented frameworks, used to achieve the systematic reuse of networked application software. ACE frameworks handle common network programming tasks and can be customized using C++ language features to produce complete distributed applications. C++ Network Programming, Volume 2, focuses on ACE frameworks, providing thorough coverage of the concepts, patterns, and usage rules that form their structure. This book is a practical guide to designing object-oriented frameworks and shows developers how to apply frameworks to concurrent networked applications. C++ Networking, Volume 1, introduced ACE and the wrapper facades, which are basic network computing ingredients. Volume 2 explains how frameworks build on wrapper facades to provide higher-level communication services. Written by two experts in the ACE community, this book contains: An overview of ACE frameworks Design dimensions for networked services Descriptions of the key capabilities of the most important ACE frameworks Numerous C++ code examples that demonstrate how to use ACE frameworks C++ Network Programming, Volume 2, teaches how to use frameworks to write networked applications quickly, reducing development effort and overhead. It will be an invaluable asset to any C++ developer working on networked applications.","publisher":"Addison-Wesley Professional","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u1mKwaIbLwsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":384,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u1mKwaIbLwsC&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u1mKwaIbLwsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=156&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780201563825","title":"C++ Strategies and Tactics","author":"Robert B.

For those learning C pointers are a great source of confusion. Instead of treating pointers as a separate topic, their use is integrated into every feature of C. When you learn functions, you learn how pointers work with functions, when you learn structures you learn pointers to structures, when you learn C++ objects, you learn how pointers are used with objects, when you learn arrays you learn every aspect of using pointers and arrays. Because of their special relationship to pointers, arrays are covered in depth in their own section. While useful for readers with little knowledge of programming, it also covers advanced features of C and C++. Each new feature is explained with simple and increasingly complex examples. Special care is taken to explain in detail the relationship between pointers and arrays.

Areas of focus include optimizing high-level logical structures, creating effective mathematical algorithms, and working with strings and arrays. Code optimization is considered for the Intel platform, taking into account features of the latest models of Intel Pentium processors and how using Assembly code in C++ applications can improve application processing. The use of an assembler to optimize C++ applications is examined in two ways, by developing and compiling Assembly modules that can be linked with the main program written in C++ and using the built-in assembler.

While sequential applications are routinely ported to platforms ranging from PCs to mainframes, most parallel programs only ever run on one type of machine. One reason for this is that most parallel programming systems have failed to insulate their users from the architectures of the machines on which they have run. Those that have been platform-independent have usually also had poor performance. Many researchers now believe that object-oriented languages may offer a solution. By hiding the architecture-specific constructs required for high performance inside platform-independent abstractions, parallel object-oriented programming systems may be able to combine the speed of massively-parallel computing with the comfort of sequential programming. \"Parallel Programming Using C++\" describes fifteen parallel programming systems based on C++, the most popular object-oriented language of today. These systems cover the whole spectrum of parallel programming paradigms, from data parallelism through dataflow and distributed shared memory to message-passing control parallelism. For the parallel programming community, a common parallel application is discussed in each chapter, as part of the description of the system itself. By comparing the implementations of the polygon overlay problem in each system, the reader can get a better sense of their expressiveness and functionality for a common problem. For the systems community, the chapters contain a discussion of the implementation of thevarious compilers and runtime systems. In addition to discussing the performance of polygon overlay, several of the contributors also discuss the performance of other, more substantial, applications. For the research community, the contributors discuss the motivations for and philosophy of their systems. As well, many of the chapters include critiques that complete the research arc by pointing out possible future research directions. Finally, for the object-oriented community, there are many examples of how encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism can be used to control the complexity of developing, debugging, and tuning parallel software. \"Scientific and Engineering Computation series\"","publisher":"MIT Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n3kA3FzBTnEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":758,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":2.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n3kA3FzBTnEC&pg=PA465&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=199&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780471065654","title":"C++ complete: a reference and tutorial to the proposed C++ standard","author":"Anthony S.

With Rcpp, the transfer of data between R and C++ is nearly seamless, and high-performance statistical computing is finally accessible to most R users. Rcpp should be part of every statistician's toolbox. -- Michael Braun, MIT Sloan School of Management \"Seamless R and C++ integration with Rcpp\" is simply a wonderful book. For anyone who uses C/C++ and R, it is an indispensable resource. The writing is outstanding. A huge bonus is the section on applications. This section covers the matrix packages Armadillo and Eigen and the GNU Scientific Library as well as RInside which enables you to use R inside C++. These applications are what most of us need to know to really do scientific programming with R and C++. I love this book. -- Robert McCulloch, University of Chicago Booth School of Business Rcpp is now considered an essential package for anybody doing serious computational research using R. Dirk's book is an excellent companion and takes the reader from a gentle introduction to more advanced applications via numerous examples and efficiency enhancing gems. The book is packed with all you might have ever wanted to know about Rcpp, its cousins (RcppArmadillo, RcppEigen .etc.), modules, package development and sugar. Overall, this book is a must-have on your shelf. -- Sanjog Misra, UCLA Anderson School of Management The Rcpp package represents a major leap forward for scientific computations with R. With very few lines of C++ code, one has R's data structures readily at hand for further computations in C++. Hence, high-level numerical programming can be made in C++ almost as easily as in R, but often with a substantial speed gain. Dirk is a crucial person in these developments, and his book takes the reader from the first fragile steps on to using the full Rcpp machinery. A very recommended book! -- Søren Højsgaard, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Aalborg University, Denmark \"Seamless R and C ++ Integration with Rcpp\" provides the first comprehensive introduction to Rcpp. Rcpp has become the most widely-used language extension for R, and is deployed by over one-hundred different CRAN and BioConductor packages. Rcpp permits users to pass scalars, vectors, matrices, list or entire R objects back and forth between R and C++ with ease. This brings the depth of the R analysis framework together with the power, speed, and efficiency of C++. Dirk Eddelbuettel has been a contributor to CRAN for over a decade and maintains around twenty packages. He is the Debian/Ubuntu maintainer for R and other quantitative software, edits the CRAN Task Views for Finance and High-Performance Computing, is a co-founder of the annual R/Finance conference, and an editor of the Journal of Statistical Software. He holds a Ph.D. in Mathematical Economics from EHESS (Paris), and works in Chicago as a Senior Quantitative Analyst.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AXtDAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":220,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AXtDAAAAQBAJ&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AXtDAAAAQBAJ&pg=PR23&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=235&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"Introduction to C++ programming: ","author":"Booksmart","publish_date":"2014-10-20","description":"Unit–IProgramming Logic and techniques : Algorithms, Flow-charts, Program Design, Introduction to C++: Origin of C++, A Sample C++ program, pitfall and programming tips.

Indeed, this is already happening. While several finance books provide C++ code for pricing derivatives and performing numerical calculations, none approaches the topic from a system design perspective. This book will be divided into two sections-programming techniques and automated trading system ( ATS ) technology-and teach financial system design and development from the absolute ground up using Microsoft Visual C++.NET 2005. MS Visual C++.NET 2005 has been chosen as the implementation language primarily because most trading firms and large banks have developed and continue to develop their proprietary algorithms in ISO C++ and Visual C++.NET provides the greatest flexibility for incorporating these legacy algorithms into working systems. Furthermore, the .NET Framework and development environment provide the best libraries and tools for rapid development of trading systems. The first section of the book explains Visual C++.NET 2005 in detail and focuses on the required programming knowledge for automated trading system development, including object oriented design, delegates and events, enumerations, random number generation, timing and timer objects, and data management with STL.NET and .NET collections. Furthermore, since most legacy code and modeling code in the financial markets is done in ISO C++, this book looks in depth at several advanced topics relating to managed/unmanaged/COM memory management and interoperability. Further, this book provides dozens of examples illustrating the use of database connectivity with ADO.NET and an extensive treatment of SQL and FIX and XML/FIXML. Advanced programming topics such as threading, sockets, as well as using C++.NET to connect to Excel are also discussed at length and supported by examples. The second section of the book explains technological concerns and design concepts for automated trading systems. Specifically, chapters are devoted to handling real-time data feeds, managing orders in the exchange order book, position selection, and risk management. A .dll is included in the book that will emulate connection to a widely used industry API ( Trading Technologies, Inc.’s XTAPI ) and provide ways to test position and order management algorithms. Design patterns are presented for market taking systems based upon technical analysis as well as for market making systems using intermarket spreads. As all of the chapters revolve around computer programming for financial engineering and trading system development, this book will educate traders, financial engineers, quantitative analysts, students of quantitative finance and even experienced programmers on technological issues that revolve around development of financial applications in a Microsoft environment and the construction and implementation of real-time trading systems and tools. * Teaches financial system design and development from the ground up using Microsoft Visual C++.NET 2005. * Provides dozens of examples illustrating the programming approaches in the book * Chapters are supported by screenshots, equations, sample Excel spreadsheets, and programming code","publisher":"Academic Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zQLpvF_xRw0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":336,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zQLpvF_xRw0C&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":3.0,"ratings_count":2,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zQLpvF_xRw0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=253&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"Signal and Image Processing with Neural Networks: A C++ Sourcebook","author":"Timothy Masters","publish_date":"1994-07-25","description":"The first book to offer practical applications of neural networks to solve problems in digital signal processing and imaging.

Deitels' C++ How to Program is the most comprehensive, practical introduction to C++ ever published-with hundreds of hands-on exercises, roughly 250 complete programs written and documented for easy learning, and exceptional insight into good programming practices, maximizing performance, avoiding errors, debugging, and testing. The updated Sixth Edition now includes an introduction to the Internet and World Wide Web with an emphasis on Web 2.0; a new chapter on game programming with the OGRE graphics library and Open AL; an overview of the forthcoming C++Ox standard; and a new chapter on the Open Source Boost libraries. The new edition continues to use string and vector classes to make earlier examples more object-oriented. Large chapters are broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces. Also included are separate chapters on recursion and searching/sorting. The Sixth Edition retains every key concept and technique ANSI C++ developers need to master; control statements, functions, arrays, pointers and strings, classes and data abstraction, operator overloading, inheritance, virtual functions, polymorphism, I/O, templates, exception handling, file processing, data structures, and more. It alsoincludes a detailed introduction to Standard Template Library (STL) containers, container adapters, algorithms, and iterators. The accompanying CD-ROM includes all the source code from the book. Aimed at readers with little or no programming experience, this text teaches programming by presenting the concepts in the contexxt of full working programs and takes an early objects approach and is a valuable reference for programmers and anyone interested in learning the C++ programming language and object-oriented development in C++.","publisher":"Prentice Hall","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HhGB8fOiUy8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":1429,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":85,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HhGB8fOiUy8C&q=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=271&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780471123262","title":"Building a 3D Game Engine in C++","author":"Brian Hook","publish_date":"1995-07-06","description":"Everything you need to create your own 3D game engine Most game programming books hand you a finished game engine and then tell you how to add on a few features, so you're locked into someone else's design from the beginning.

It has something of a unique character among all the .NET languages. Unlike the other Visual Studio languages, Visual C++ .NET can produce both unmanaged (native) code, and managed code that runs on the Common Language Runtime (CLR), the \"virtual machine\" which underlies Microsoft's new platform, the .NET Framework. This unique status makes C++ a much more powerful language than other .NET languages - not only can it bypass the CLR when maximum performance is needed, it can also interoperate far more seamlessly with existing applications. This book provides in-depth coverage of everything that's new in this latest version of Visual C++, including the new Managed Extensions which allow us to write code that runs on the CLR, the C++ attributes which simplify traditional COM programming enormously, and ATL Server, which provides an easy way to write ISAPI filters to expose web services. Instead of providing an overview of the enormous .NET class libraries, we concentrate throughout on those features that you will actually use in Visual C++ .NET, and in particular on the powerful features for interaction between managed code and existing unmanaged C++ applications.","publisher":"Apress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=c_Azt-G0qYAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":461,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c_Azt-G0qYAC&q=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=287&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"Java with Borland C++","author":"Chris H.

The skills of computer programming are very important in our present world, and these skills are likely to become even more important in the future. On the pages of this book, the reader is introduced in a natural way to the world of computer programming. The reader does not require any previous knowledge of the subject. The basic operating principles of computers are taught before the actual studies of computer programming begin. All the examples of computer programs are written so that the reader encounters a lot of natural-language expressions instead of the traditional abbreviations of the computer world. This approach aims to make learning easier. The pages of the book are designed to maximize readability and understandability. Examples of computer programs are presented in easy-to-read graphical descriptions. Because the pages of the book are large, example programs can be presented in more reader-friendly way than in traditional programming books. In addition, pages are written so that the reader does not need to turn them unnecessarily. This book uses a programming language called C++ (pronounced \"see plus plus\") to teach computer programming. C++ is suitable for beginners in the field of computer programming because with C++ it is possible to make simple programs, and build a solid understanding of the basics of computing and programming. Plenty of programming exercises are included in the book. The reader can work with the exercises by using free programming tools on a personal computer. The book explains how to download the free programming tools from the Internet. This book is a new kind of book to learn computer programming. Making things clear and eliminating risks for misunderstanding have been primary concerns in the design of the book. Because in some ways the book is less mathematical than other programming books, some experienced computer programmers may hesitate to use it. However, for a beginner in the field of computer programming, this book offers a possibility to make learning easier. Also more experienced people can benefit from the book if they are prepared to discard the traditional abbreviations in computer programs, and follow the programming style that is advocated in the book.","publisher":"Trafford Publishing","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Q7C5i6uHrBkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":616,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q7C5i6uHrBkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=289&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780763708580","title":"Essentials of C++: A Lab Course Through Arrays","author":"Nell B.

As software becomes increasingly distributed, high-quality infrastructure becomes ever more important. Precisely written, replete with advanced code examples, and based on Randall Maddox' extensive experience teaching advanced C++, this book gives working C++ developers the insights and sophisticated techniques they need to build superior software infrastructure. Maddox begins by introducing the context required to support a distributed Web application in a Unix environment. He then presents the utility classes that illustrate crucial design and implementation issues and serve as building blocks for a distributed software architecture. Coverage includes concrete data types, templates, containers, namespaces, error handling, and an automated solution for the hazards of dynamic memory allocation. Maddox reviews C++ program startup and memory usage in detail, laying the groundwork for a full of understanding of multiprocessing, multithreading, and interprocess communication. Unlike most advanced C++ books, Distributed Application Programming in C++ goes beyond coding, introducing superior strategies for enterprise software development. Maddox presents key design/implementation tradeoffs, managing source code organization, build-time issues, the run-time environment, and more.

Dissection is a unique pedagogical tool first developed by the author to point out key features of program code. It is similar to a structured walk-through of the code, with the intention of explaining newly encountered programming elements and idioms as found in working code. The book includes a CD-ROM containing a compiler and an electronic version of the book that allows readers to search, take notes, and highlight right on their computer. Each chapter presents a number of carefully explained programs, which lead the reader in a holistic manner to ever-improving programming skills. Right from the start, the reader is introduced to complete programs, and at an early point in the book, the reader is introduced to writing functions as a major feature of structured programming. It contains four to seven small code dissections per chapter, and then each chapter culminates with a larger, extended code dissection. \"Software Engineering\" sections in each chapter reinforce sound software engineering skills.

There have been books that discuss some features of the iostreams. There have been a few books that discuss various components of the Standard Template Library. But this book brings together in one place a complete tutorial and reference on the latest ANSI/ISO standard for C++ class library. This book is an easy to understand introduction to the object oriented components that are now part of the C++ language. This book takes a component approach towards explaining the standard C++ objects and how to use them. In this book you will find simple but complete coverage of * Object oriented Input and Output Using the Iostream classes * String class * Container classes and STL Algorithm Building Blocks * Exception Classes and Error Handling Objects * Language Support & Internationalization Classes * Iterator Classes * Numerics and Math Classes * Object Oriented Memory Management Components * Interfacing C++ objects with Java Objects Mastering The Essential C++ Classes shows the programmer how to use these built in components to speed up and simplify software development efforts of all sizes. The authors demonstrate how these components can be easily added together to build whatever kind of software object that is needed. The authors describe each component from the logical view, architectural view, and protocol view. This invaluable tutorial and reference shows how the standard C++ components fit together and how they can be combined with objects from other languages such as Java. Every example in this book is presented using the ANSI/ISO standards for the C++ classes and can be used in the Unix, Linux, MVS,VM, VMS, OS/2, Windows and Macintosh environments. The complete source code contained in this book can be found on the enclosed CD-ROM. The CD-ROM also contains a complete reference to the standard C++ classes. Cameron Hughes is a software engineer at Ctest Laboratories, and a staff programmer/analyst at Youngstown State University. He spends most of his time developing large scale C++ class libraries, inference engines and information analysis tools. Tracey Hughes is a senior programmer at Ctest laboratories specializing in pattern-recognition class libraries, discrete event simulation and image processing software.

Bringing together the main articles that presented the design alternatives in that debate, The Evolution of C++ explores the underlying concepts of this exceedingly popular language, explaining why C++ looks and behaves the way it does. From a commercial standpoint, C++ combines the best of two worlds: it is object oriented and it is a version of C, the single most popular programming language for microcomputers. Originally developed by Bjarne Stroustrup and others at AT&T Bell Labs during the mid 1980s, C++ evolved further in response to the real and perceived needs of its users. Part I chronicles the early days of C++, beginning with what, from the original Santa Fe workshop, looked like a great new object-oriented language with a straightforward future. The next four parts are organized around major debates that developed later about such added features as multiple inheritance, exception handling, runtime typing, and distributed computing. In his postscript, Waldo notes that in the process of evolving through \"the marketplace of ideas,\" a clearly articulated, generally accepted design center for the language has been lost. Although C++ has adapted to the changing environment of the increasing number of users, there is at present no common agreement about what it should or should not do in the future.

Many of the basic techniques for constructing and governing access to data structures are well-documented, but most are structured programming techniques that do not translate well in an object-oriented environment. Object-Oriented C++ Data Structures for Real Programmers corrects this imbalance, teaching experienced C++ and Java developers the most effective methods for designing and implementing highly functional data structures in any type of object-oriented programming effort. The first part of the book introduces the various approaches, focusing on the purposes for which each is most suited. From there, the author examines advanced functionality that can be achieved in a number of ways, helping readers choose and apply the optimal technique. Key Features * Advanced coverage from an accomplished developer and programming author * Written explicitly for experienced object-oriented programmers * Helps you choose the best way to build the desired functionality, then provides the instruction you need to do it * Covers all major data structure approaches, including arrays, vectors, lists, stacks, and queues * Explains how to achieve a wide range of functionality, including data sorting, searching, hashing, dictionaries, and indexes","publisher":"Morgan Kaufmann Pub","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ICw-NehpHbIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":552,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ICw-NehpHbIC&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=371&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780387988573","title":"Using the STL: The C++ Standard Template Library","author":"Robert Robson","publish_date":"1999-12-03","description":"A comprehensive introduction and guide to the STL, pitched at the level of readers already familiar with C++.

They help you manage memory and process strings more easily. They provide containers and other data structures that go well beyond what the standard library offers. They make it easy to build platform-independent network applications. Simply put, these 72 libraries greatly expand your C++ toolbox. The second edition contains more than 430 examples. All examples are as short as possible, but they are complete, so you can compile and run them as is. They show you what the Boost libraries offer and give you a head start on using the libraries in your own applications. The goal of this book is to increase your efficiency as a C++ developer and to simplify software development with C++. The Boost libraries introduced in this book will help you write less code with fewer bugs and finish projects faster. You code will be more concise and self-explanatory and more easily adapted when requirements change. The second edition is based on the Boost libraries 1.55.0 and 1.56.0 with the latter version having been released in August 2014. The examples are based on C++11 and have been tested with Visual Studio 2013, GCC 4.8 and Clang 3.3 on various platforms. For Boost libraries which were incorporated into the C++11 standard library, differences between Boost and the standard library are highlighted. The Boost libraries are one of the most important and influential open source C++ libraries. Their source code is available under a permissive free software license. Several Boost libraries have been incorporated into the C++11 standard library. The Boost libraries are developed and supported by the Boost community - a worldwide developer community with a strong interest in pushing C++ boundaries further.","publisher":"Boris Schäling","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2jUVBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":570,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2jUVBQAAQBAJ&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2jUVBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=379&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"Beginning Visual C++ 5","author":"Ivor Horton","publish_date":"1997","description":"This book is for anyone who wants to learn C++ and Windows programming with Visual C++5 and MFC.

Having analyzed tens of thousands of vulnerability reports since 1988, CERT has determined that a relatively small number of root causes account for most of the vulnerabilities. Secure Coding in C and C++, Second Edition, identifies and explains these root causes and shows the steps that can be taken to prevent exploitation. Moreover, this book encourages programmers to adopt security best practices and to develop a security mindset that can help protect software from tomorrow’s attacks, not just today’s. Drawing on the CERT’s reports and conclusions, Robert C. Seacord systematically identifies the program errors most likely to lead to security breaches, shows how they can be exploited, reviews the potential consequences, and presents secure alternatives. Coverage includes technical detail on how to Improve the overall security of any C or C++ application Thwart buffer overflows, stack-smashing, and return-oriented programming attacks that exploit insecure string manipulation logic Avoid vulnerabilities and security flaws resulting from the incorrect use of dynamic memory management functions Eliminate integer-related problems resulting from signed integer overflows, unsigned integer wrapping, and truncation errors Perform secure I/O, avoiding file system vulnerabilities Correctly use formatted output functions without introducing format-string vulnerabilities Avoid race conditions and other exploitable vulnerabilities while developing concurrent code The second edition features Updates for C11 and C++11 Significant revisions to chapters on strings, dynamic memory management, and integer security A new chapter on concurrency Access to the online secure coding course offered through Carnegie Mellon’s Open Learning Initiative (OLI) Secure Coding in C and C++, Second Edition, presents hundreds of examples of secure code, insecure code, and exploits, implemented for Windows and Linux.

Visual C++ 6.0 was released in 1998 as a component of Visual Studio 6.0. For three years, until the launch of Visual Studio .NET to support the .NET Framework, it was Microsoft's premier development product. Now five service packs old, version 6.0 remains the environment of choice for many developers who haven't yet made the move to .NET. If your aim is to learn how to program in C++ on the Windows platform, with all the help offered by the Visual Studio interface, Visual C++ 6.0 remains a sound choice. What does this book cover? Beginning Visual C++ 6 can be broken down into four sections. The first is a fast-paced but thorough tutorial to the C++ language, punctuated with interesting and worthwhile example programs. After that, you'll learn about object orientation with C++, and how this relates to Windows programming - the section ends with the design and implementation of a sizable class-based C++ application. The third part of the book walks the reader through creating Windows applications using the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC). This includes the following: Outputting to the screen and printer Creating menus, toolbars, and dialogs Debugging your program Responding to a user's actions To illustrate the theory, this section also includes the complete implementation of a simple but fully-featured drawing application. The final section comprises a grounding in programmatic database access, an introduction to Microsoft's Component Object Model (COM), and examples of how to create ActiveX controls using both MFC and the Active Template Library (ATL). This book was voted Amazon.com's C++ Book of the Year in 1998. It contains countless examples for you to follow and experiment with, and there are challenging exercises and model solutions in every chapter. Who is this book for? This book is for anyone who wants to learn C++ and Windows programming with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. Although progress will be easier if you have some experience of a programming discipline, an adept newcomer will also succeed in taming object-oriented programming and writing real Windows applications.","publisher":"Wrox","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3SJPQAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":1224,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":3.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3SJPQAAACAAJ&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=420&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781489966292","title":"Object-Oriented Software in C++","author":"Michael A.

In Exceptional C++ Style , legendary C++ guru Herb Sutter presents 40 new programming scenarios designed to analyze not only the what but the why and help you find just the right balance in your software. Organized around practical problems and solutions, this book offers new insight into crucial C++ details and interrelationships, and new strategies for today's key C++ programming techniques--including generic programming, STL, exception safety, and more. You'll find answers to questions like: What can you learn about library design from the STL itself? How do you avoid making templated code needlessly non-generic? Why shouldn't you specialize function templates? What should you do instead? How does exception safety go beyond try and catch statements? Should you use exception specifications, or not? When and how should you \"leak\" the private parts of a class? How do you make classes safer for versioning? What's the real memory cost of using standard containers? How can using const really optimize your code? How does writing inline affect performance? When does code that looks wrong actually compile and run perfectly, and why should you care? What's wrong with the design of std::string? Exceptional C++ Style will help you design, architect, and code with style--and achieve greater robustness and performance in all your C++ software.","publisher":"Granite Hill Publishers","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pY3CAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":325,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pY3CAwAAQBAJ&dq=c%2B%2B,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=435&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"Understanding Program Design and Data Structures with C++","author":"Kenneth A.

In this book, author Ivor Horton explains what the class and function templates available with C++ 14 do, and how to use them in a practical context. You'll learn how to create containers, and how iterators are used with them to access, modify, and extend the data elements they contain. You'll also learn about stream iterators that can transfer data between containers and streams, including file streams. The function templates that define algorithms are explained in detail, and you'll learn how to pass function objects or lambda expressions to them to customize their behavior. Many working examples are included to demonstrate how to apply the algorithms with different types of containers. After reading this book, you will understand the scope and power of the templates that the C++ 14 Standard Library includes and how these can greatly reduce the coding and development time for many applications. You'll be able to combine the class and function templates to great effect in dealing with real-world problems. The templates in the Standard Library provide you as a C++ programmer with a comprehensive set of efficiently implemented generic programming tools that you can use for most types of application. How to use Standard Library templates with your C++ applications.“/li> Understand the different types of containers that are available and what they are used for.

More specifically, the C++ Standard Library Quick Reference is a compact collection of essential classes and functions, used by C++ programmers on a daily basis. It features core classes for strings, I/O streams, and various generic containers, as well as a comprehensive set of algorithms to manipulate them. In recent years, the C++11 and C++14 standards have added even more efficient container classes, a new powerful regular expression library, and a portable multithreading library featuring threads, mutexes, condition variables, and atomic variables. Needless to say, it is hard to know and remember all the possibilities, details, and intricacies of this vast and growing library. This handy reference guide is therefore indispensable to any C++ programmer. It offers a condensed, well-structured summary of all essential aspects of the C++ Standard Library, including all aforementioned functionality. No page-long, repetitive examples or obscure, rarely used features. Instead, everything you need to know and watch out for in practice is outlined in a compact, to-the-point style, interspersed with well-chosen, clarifying examples. The book does not explain the C++ language or syntax, but is accessible to anyone with basic C++ knowledge. Even the most experienced C++ programmer though will learn a thing or two from it and find it a useful memory-aid.

La plataforma .NET es un framework que pone a disposición de las aplicaciones los servicios que estas necesitan, ya sean comunicaciones con servidores corporativos, interoperabilidad a través de Internet o características avanzadas para las interfaces gráficas de usuario. La nueva versión de Microsoft Visual C++ .NET supone la integración transparente del lenguaje C++ con el resto de la arquitectura .NET. De este modo, el paradigma de la programación orientada a objetos, junto a la potencia de los servicios distribuidos .NET se convierten en un tándem difícil de superar a la hora de crear aplicaciones bajo Windows. El software escrito para .NET es más escalable, seguro y portable que cualquier otra tecnología Windows anterior. Este libro, totalmente actualizado, realiza un riguroso análisis de las características más importantes, básicas y avanzadas, disponibles bajo el entorno de programación Microsoft Visual Studio .NET, permitiéndole aprender lógica de programación y el uso de algoritmos.
