Paul Ferrill leads you from installing the Scripting Layer for Android (SL4A) to writing small scripts, to more complicated and interesting projects, and finally to uploading and packaging your programs to an Android device. Android runs scripts in many scripting languages, but Python, Lua, and Beanshell are particularly popular. Most programmers know more than one programming language, so that they have the best tool for whatever task they want to accomplish. Pro Android Python with SL4A explores the world of Android scripting by introducing you to the most important open-source programming languages that are available on Android-based hardware. Pro Android Python with SL4A starts by exploring the Android software development kit and then shows you how to set up an Eclipse-based Android development environment. You then approach the world of Android programming by using Beanshell, which runs on the Dalvik, and learning how to write small programs to administer an Android device. Next, discover how Lua, a lightweight language perfectly suited for scripting on smaller devices, can work with Android. Lua can be used for small but important tasks, like SMS encryption and synchronizing photos with flickr. Last, but certainly not least, you will discover the world of Python scripting for SL4A, and the power contained within the full range of Python modules that can combine with the Android SDK. You'll learn to write small location-aware apps to get you started, but by the end of this book, you'll find yourself writing fully GUI-fied applications running on the Android desktop! Pro Android Python with SL4A is rounded out with a chapter on distributing and packaging scripts, a skill that you'll find very useful as you reach out to a wider audience with your programs.

It's also free and runs portably on Windows, Mac OS, Unix, and other operating systems. Python can be used for all manner of programming tasks, from CGI scripts to full-fledged applications. It is gaining popularity among programmers in part because it is easier to read (and hence, debug) than most other programming languages, and it's generally simpler to install, learn, and use. Its line structure forces consistent indentation. Its syntax and semantics make it suitable for simple scripts and large programs. Its flexible data structures and dynamic typing allow you to get a lot done in a few lines. To learn it, you'll need is some basic programming experience and a copy of Python: Visual QuickStart Guide. In patented Visual QuickStart Guide fashion, the book doesn't just tell you how to use Python to develop applications, it shows you, breaking Python into easy-to-digest, step-by-step tasks and providing example code.

The text illustrates the breadth of the modeling and analysis capabilities that are supported by the software and support of complex real-world applications. Pyomo is an open source software package for formulating and solving large-scale optimization and operations research problems. The text begins with a tutorial on simple linear and integer programming models. A detailed reference of Pyomo's modeling components is illustrated with extensive examples, including a discussion of how to load data from data sources like spreadsheets and databases. Chapters describing advanced modeling capabilities for nonlinear and stochastic optimization are also included. The Pyomo software provides familiar modeling features within Python, a powerful dynamic programming language that has a very clear, readable syntax and intuitive object orientation. Pyomo includes Python classes for defining sparse sets, parameters, and variables, which can be used to formulate algebraic expressions that define objectives and constraints. Moreover, Pyomo can be used from a command-line interface and within Python's interactive command environment, which makes it easy to create Pyomo models, apply a variety of optimizers, and examine solutions. The software supports a different modeling approach than commercial AML (Algebraic Modeling Languages) tools, and is designed for flexibility, extensibility, portability, and maintainability but also maintains the central ideas in modern AMLs.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GGUw1px_Gl8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":238,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GGUw1px_Gl8C&dq=python,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GGUw1px_Gl8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=python,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=60&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780596802370","title":"Head First Programming: A Learner's Guide to Programming Using the Python Language","author":"Paul Barry, David Griffiths","publish_date":"2009-11-23","description":"Presents the concepts of writing computer programs, covering such topics as variables, loops, functions, data files and arrays, modular programming, widgets, exceptions, and objects.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E9K8Br6ZkKQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":406,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":5,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=E9K8Br6ZkKQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=python,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=61&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781430216339","title":"Python 3 for Absolute Beginners","author":"Tim Hall, J-P Stacey","publish_date":"2010-03-10","description":"There are many more people who want to study programming other than aspiring computer scientists with a passing grade in advanced calculus.

The \"Heartbleed\" vulnerability has revealed significant weaknesses within enterprise environments related to the lack of a definitive mapping of network assets. In Python Passive Network Mapping, Chet Hosmer shows you how to effectively and definitively passively map networks. Active or probing methods to network mapping have traditionally been used, but they have many drawbacks - they can disrupt operations, crash systems, and - most importantly - miss critical nefarious activity. You require an accurate picture of the environments you protect and operate in order to rapidly investigate, mitigate, and then recover from these new attack vectors. This book gives you a deep understanding of new innovations to passive network mapping, while delivering open source Python-based tools that can be put into practice immediately. Python Passive Network Mapping is for practitioners, forensic investigators, IT teams, and individuals who work together when performing incident response and investigating potential damage, or are examining the impacts of new malware threats. Those defending critical infrastructures will have a special interest in this book, as active or probing methods of network mapping are rarely used within these environments as any resulting impacts can be disastrous. Python Passive Network Mapping is ideally suited for use as a text in a variety of academic programs to expose and engage students in the art of passively mapping enterprise networks, with the added benefit of providing exposure to open source Python solutions.

Mark Summerfield focuses on four key themes: design patterns for coding elegance, faster processing through concurrency and compiled Python (Cython), high-level networking, and graphics. He identifies well-proven design patterns that are useful in Python, illuminates them with expert-quality code, and explains why some object-oriented design patterns are irrelevant to Python. He also explodes several counterproductive myths about Python programming--showing, for example, how Python can take full advantage of multicore hardware. All examples, including three complete case studies, have been tested with Python 3.3 (and, where possible, Python 3.2 and 3.1) and crafted to maintain compatibility with future Python 3.x versions.

These algorithms deal with common scenarios faced by all data analysts and data scientists. This book focuses on two algorithm families (linear methods and ensemble methods) that effectively predict outcomes. This type of problem covers a multitude of use cases (what ad to place on a web page, predicting prices in securities markets, detecting credit card fraud, etc.). The focus on two families gives enough room for full descriptions of the mechanisms at work in the algorithms. Then the code examples serve to illustrate the workings of the machinery with specific hackable code. The author will explain in simple terms, using no complex math, how these algorithms work, and will then show how to apply them in Python. He will also provide advice on how to select from among these algorithms, and will show how to prepare the data, and how to use the trained models in practice. The author begins with an overview of the two core algorithms, explaining the types of problems solved by each one. He then introduces a core set of Python programming techniques that can be used to apply these algorithms. The author shows various techniques for building predictive models that solve a range of problems, from simple to complex; he also shows how to measure the performance of each model to ensure you use the right one. The following chapters provide a deep dive into each of the two algorithms: penalized linear regression and ensemble methods. Chapters will show how to apply each algorithm in Python. Readers can directly use the sample code to build their own solutions.","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8_rzBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":336,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8_rzBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=python,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=120&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780134026329","title":"Introduction to Computing and Programming in Python","author":"Mark J.

Jones, Fred L. Drake Jr","publish_date":"2001-12-18","description":"If you are a Python programmer who wants to incorporate XML into your skill set, this is the book for you. Python has attracted a wide variety of developers, who use it either as glue to connect critical programming tasks together, or as a complete cross-platform application development language. Yet, because it is object-oriented and has powerful text manipulation abilities, Python is an ideal language for manipulating XML.Python & XML gives you a solid foundation for using these two languages together. Loaded with practical examples, this new volume highlights common application tasks, so that you can learn by doing. The book starts with the basics then quickly progresses to complex topics, like transforming XML with XSLT, querying XML with XPath, and working with XML dialects and validation. It also explores the more advanced issues: using Python with SOAP and distributed web services, and using Python to create scalable streams between distributed applications (like databases and web servers).The book provides effective practical applications, while referencing many of the tools involved in XML processing and Python, and highlights cross-platform issues along with tasks relevant to enterprise computing. You will find ample coverage of XML flow analysis and details on ways in which you can transport XML through your network.Whether you are using Python as an application language, or as an administrative or middleware scripting language, you are sure to benefit from this book. If you want to use Python to manipulate XML, this is your guide.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=El4TAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":380,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=El4TAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT18&dq=python,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=134&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780521895835","title":"Python Programming for Biology","author":"Tim J.

The author Sylvain Hellegouarch is dedicated to the development of free software projects and has been coordinating and administrating the community efforts around the CherryPy project since 2004. The approach based on an example application introduces many other common Python libraries, providing transferable skills also relevant for non-web Python projects. CherryPy is a Python library for web development that allows developers to build web applications in the same way as any other object-oriented Python program. Enriched by several years of active development, it has become one of the most established toolkits for building solid and high-performance web applications in Python. CherryPy abstracts the complex low-level HTTP protocol into an easy-to-use interface that respects Python idioms. The library aims at being simple to learn for a beginner while offering the most advanced features to fluent Python developers. For these reasons CherryPy was chosen to be at the heart of the popular and feature-rich TurboGears web framework. CherryPy-powered web applications are stand-alone Python applications with their own embedded multi-threaded web server, but can also run behind Apache or IIS for scalability. .CherryPy installation using tarball, egg, and subversion .The CherryPy library in depth: its design and how to use it .Using CherryPy with common Python and non-Python products .Object Relational Mapping with SQLObject, SQLAlchemy, and Dejavu .Web Services via REST and the Atom Publishing Protocol .AJAX and client-side scripting via MochiKit .Unit, functional, and load testing .CherryPy, Apache, and lighttpd deployment solurions The book starts with two chapters dedicated to CherryPy itself, its history and installation. Then it moves through a gentle introduction to the main features and concepts of CherryPy to a thorough review of its core capabilities. After laying this foundation the book dives into a real-world example, detailing important steps in the creation of a photoblog application. These chapters cover database manipulation via Object Relational Mapping (ORM), using web services to enhance the application, and client-side scripting through AJAX. Finally, the book covers the need for unit, functional, and performance testing before closing with deployment solutions for a CherryPy-based application. Who this book is written for This book is principally geared towards Python web developers, who are looking to add the power of the CherryPy library to their existing Python skillset. It assumes a good working knowledge of Python . Although the CherryPy toolkit is at the core of the book, many other common libraries are introduced.

This title is intended for beginners to Python with little or no knowledge of game development, and it covers step by step how to build seven different games, from the well-known Space Invaders to a classical 3D platformer. What You Will Learn Take advantage of Python's clean syntax to build games quickly Discover distinct frameworks for developing graphical applications Implement non-player characters (NPCs) with autonomous and seemingly intelligent behaviors Design and code some popular games like Pong and tower defense Compose maps and levels for your sprite-based games in an easy manner Modularize and apply object-oriented principles during the design of your games Exploit libraries like Chimpunk2D, cocos2d, and Tkinter Create natural user interfaces (NUIs), using a camera and computer vision algorithms to interpret the player's real-world actions In Detail With a growing interest in learning to program, game development is an appealing topic for getting started with coding. From geometry to basic Artificial Intelligence algorithms, there are plenty of concepts that can be applied in almost every game. Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale. It is the third most popular language whose grammatical syntax is not predominantly based on C. Python is also very easy to code and is also highly flexible, which is exactly what is required for game development. The user-friendliness of this language allows beginners to code games without too much effort or training. Python also works with very little code and in most cases uses the “use cases” approach, reserving lengthy explicit coding for outliers and exceptions, making game development an achievable feat. Python Game Programming by Example enables readers to develop cool and popular games in Python without having in-depth programming knowledge of Python. The book includes seven hands-on projects developed with several well-known Python packages, as well as a comprehensive explanation about the theory and design of each game. It will teach readers about the techniques of game design and coding of some popular games like Pong and tower defense. Thereafter, it will allow readers to add levels of complexities to make the games more fun and realistic using 3D. At the end of the book, you will have added several GUI libraries like Chimpunk2D, cocos2d, and Tkinter in your tool belt, as well as a handful of recipes and algorithms for developing games with Python. Style and approach This book is an example-based guide that will teach you to build games using Python. This book follows a step-by-step approach as it is aimed at beginners who would like to get started with basic game development. By the end of this book you will be competent game developers with good knowledge of programming in Python.","publisher":"Packt Publishing Ltd","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=99lOCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":230,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=99lOCwAAQBAJ&dq=python,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=99lOCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=python,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=186&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781593276034","title":"Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming","author":"Eric Matthes","publish_date":"2015-11-20","description":"Learn Python—Fast!

Prior programming experience with Python would be useful but not essential. Anyone with general knowledge of programming languages should be able to pick up the book and understand the principals involved. What You Will Learn Extract data from web pages with simple Python programming Build a threaded crawler to process web pages in parallel Follow links to crawl a website Download cache to reduce bandwidth Use multiple threads and processes to scrape faster Learn how to parse JavaScript-dependent websites Interact with forms and sessions Solve CAPTCHAs on protected web pages Discover how to track the state of a crawl In Detail The Internet contains the most useful set of data ever assembled, largely publicly accessible for free. However, this data is not easily reusable. It is embedded within the structure and style of websites and needs to be carefully extracted to be useful. Web scraping is becoming increasingly useful as a means to easily gather and make sense of the plethora of information available online. Using a simple language like Python, you can crawl the information out of complex websites using simple programming. This book is the ultimate guide to using Python to scrape data from websites. In the early chapters it covers how to extract data from static web pages and how to use caching to manage the load on servers. After the basics we'll get our hands dirty with building a more sophisticated crawler with threads and more advanced topics. Learn step-by-step how to use Ajax URLs, employ the Firebug extension for monitoring, and indirectly scrape data. Discover more scraping nitty-gritties such as using the browser renderer, managing cookies, how to submit forms to extract data from complex websites protected by CAPTCHA, and so on.

Check with the seller before completing your purchase. Introduction to Programming Using Python is intended for use in the introduction to programming course. Daniel Liang is known for his \"fundamentals-first\" approach to teaching programming concepts and techniques. \"Fundamentals-first\" means that students learn fundamental programming concepts like selection statements, loops, and functions, before moving into defining classes. Students learn basic logic and programming concepts before moving into object-oriented programming, and GUI programming. Another aspect of Introduction to Programming Using Python is that in addition to the typical programming examples that feature games and some math, Liang gives an example or two early in the chapter that uses a simple graphic to engage the students. Rather than asking them to average 10 numbers together, they learn the concepts in the context of a fun example that generates something visually interesting. Using the graphics examples is optional in this textbook. Turtle graphics can be used in Chapters 1-5 to introduce the fundamentals of programming and Tkinter can be used for developing comprehensive graphical user interfaces and for learning object-oriented programming. 0133050556/9780133050554 Introduction to Programming Using Python plus MyProgrammingLab with Pearson eText -- Access Card, 1/e Package consists of: 0132747189/ 9780132747189 Introduction to Programming Using Python, 1/e 0133019861/ 9780133019865 MyProgrammingLab with Pearson eText -- Access Card -- for Introduction to Programming Using Python, 1/e","publisher":"Prentice Hall","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8oKrMQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":557,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8oKrMQEACAAJ&dq=python,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=230&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781784399696","title":"Spark for Python Developers","author":"Amit Nandi","publish_date":"2015-12-24","description":"A concise guide to implementing Spark Big Data analytics for Python developers, and building a real-time and insightful trend tracker data intensive appAbout This Book• Set up real-time streaming and batch data intensive infrastructure using Spark and Python• Deliver insightful visualizations in a web app using Spark (PySpark)• Inject live data using Spark Streaming with real-time eventsWho This Book Is ForThis book is for data scientists and software developers with a focus on Python who want to work with the Spark engine, and it will also benefit Enterprise Architects.

Missing or incomplete data, varying time series, and inconsistent definitions are just a few of the things that can turn our data into a mess. Data Wrangling is the process of resolving these problems with data, and this book shows you the techniques that you need, as a Python developer, to resolve the data messes that you're likely to encounter and transform them into clean datasets. So whether you're facing missing data with gaps that needs to be imputed or estimated, terrible inconsistencies across datasets, or time-series that don't seem to want to talk to each other, this book shows you the creative ways you can work with your data to get back to that clean dataset. The good news is that as a Python programmers you have a wealth of libraries at your disposal to wrangle data. This book will show you how to analyze data patterns in your datasets, across large or small domains. You will learn how to use Python's language features and libraries to manipulate and analyze data—at first, without recourse to libraries outside the standard Python download, and then to a wider library set should your wrangling needs demand it. Along the way, you'll discover two of the richest Python libraries that a data wrangler could ever wish for: ScyPy and NumPy. You don't need a degree in statistics or mathematics to use these libraries for your everyday data analysis, but knowing their data structures and fundamental algorithms helps enormously as you wrangle your data. You'll also learn how to parse and store data optimally, and what databases to use for large datasets. Whether to use relational or no-SQL databases is examined carefully as you consider your data wrangling options. Large data sets also impose their own requirements and so we find in this book how to design new libraries and how to optimize them. What you’ll learn What data wrangling is, and the Python resources to data wrangle How to establish a clean dataset from messy data!

Excerpt: RDFLib is a Python library for working with RDF, a simple yet powerful language for representing information. The library contains an RDF/XML parser/serializer that conforms to the RDF/XML Syntax Specification (Revised). The library also contains both in-memory and persistent Graph backends. It is being developed by a number of contributors and was created by Daniel Krech who continues to maintain it. RDFLib's use of various Python idioms makes them an appropriate way to introduce it to a Python programmer who hasn't used it before. RDFLib Graphs redefine certain built-in Python methods in order to behave in a predictable way. RDFLib graphs emulate container types and are best thought of as a set of 3-item triples: set()RDFLib graphs are not sorted containers; they have ordinary set operations, e.g. add to add a triple, and methods that search triples and return them in arbitrary order. The following RDFLib classes (listed below) model RDF terms in a graph and inherit off a common Identifier class, which extends Python unicode. Instances of these are nodes in an RDF graph. RDFLib provides mechanisms for managing Namespaces. In particular, there is a Namespace class which takes (as its only argument) the Base URI of the namespace.

Stackless Python, or Stackless, is a Python programming language interpreter, so named because it avoids depending on the C call stack for its own stack. The most prominent feature of Stackless is microthreads, which avoid much of the overhead associated with usual operating system threads. In addition to Python features, Stackless also adds support for coroutines, communication channels and task serialization. Stackless microthreads are managed by the language interpreter itself, not the operating system kernel-context switching and task scheduling is done purely in the interpreter (these are thus also regarded as a form of green thread). This avoids many of the overheads of threads, because no mode switching between user mode and kernel mode needs to be done, and can significantly reduce CPU load in some high-concurrency situations.","publisher":"Betascript Publishing","image_url":null,"total_pages":156,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G9RLYgEACAAJ&dq=python,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=283&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781861004147","title":"Beginning Python","author":"Brad Clements, Wrox Author Team","publish_date":"2001-04-01","description":null,"publisher":"Apress","image_url":null,"total_pages":800,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rXBgkgEACAAJ&dq=python,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=284&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781244874985","title":"Articles on Films Based on the Bible, Including: Monty Python's Life of Brian, from the Manger to the Cross, the Gospel According to St. Matthew (Film","author":"Hephaestus Books","publish_date":"2011-10-01","description":"Please note that the content of this book primarily consists of articles available from Wikipedia or other free sources online.
