To build applications which interface with Windows systems, programmers must understand and learn to use COM. Originally developed by Borland International (now Borland/Inprise) in 1995, Delphi's base has grown to over 500,000 licensed developers within the last five years. Borland has recently added an enormous amount of COM support to Delphi, but the product documentation and few chapters available provide only basic coverage of this technology. Delphi COM Programming lays the groundwork for understanding COM, and focuses on how to develop applications in Delphi which interact efficiently with Windows systems. This book includes coverage of DCOM, Microsoft's distributed architecture that is based on COM. It also covers the latest developments in Delphi 5. This book will teach COM programming to Delphi 4 and 5 programmers. After providing an understanding of the COM framework, it offers a practical exploration of COM to enable Delphi developers to program component-based applications. Typical real-world scenarios, such as Windows Shell programming, automating Microsoft Agent, and creating and using ActiveX controls, will be explored. Discussion of each topic will be illustrated with detailed examples.","publisher":"New Riders Pub","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y1-CQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":510,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y1-CQgAACAAJ&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=33&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781450597265","title":"Delphi 2010 Handbook: A Guide to the New Features of Delphi 2010; Upgrading from Delphi 2009","author":"Marco Cantu","publish_date":"2010-02-28","description":"The guide to what's new in Delphi 2010, from the best-selling author of the Mastering Delphi series and the Delphi 2007 and 2009 Handbooks.

A variety of designs can be used to this end, ranging from rigid point-to-point electronic data interchange (EDI) interactions to “Web auctions”. By updating older technologies, such as “Internet-enabling” EDI-based systems, companies can make their IT systems available to internal or external customers; but the resulting systems have not proven to be flexible enough to meet business demands. A more flexible, standardized architecture is required to better support the connection of various applications and the sharing of data. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is one such architecture. It unifies (“orchestrates”) business processes by structuring large applications as an ad-hoc collection of smaller modules called “Services”. These applications can be used by different groups of people both inside and outside the company, and new applications built from a mix of services (located in a global repository) exhibit greater agility and uniformity. Thus, SOA is a design framework for realizing rapid and low-cost system development and improving total system quality. SOA uses the Web Services standards and technologies and is rapidly becoming a standard approach for enterprise information systems integration. SOA adoption by enterprises has been identified as one of the highest business priorities by a recent Gartner study (Gartner 2007) and enterprises increasingly recognize the requirement for an increased “Service-orientation” and relevant comprehensive frameworks, which will not only help them position themselves and evaluate their SOA initiatives, but also guide them in achieving higher levels of SOA maturity. This in turn, will help enterprises acquire (and retain) competitive advantage over other players in the market who are not (using SOA and thus they are not) so flexibly adjusting themselves to address new business requirements. This book proposes a new SOA Maturity Model (MM) using a Delphi-variant technique and this constitutes one of its distinguishing features because none of the relevant existing works utilized Delphi. Moreover, the fact that the proposed SOA MM supports inter-enterprise setups makes it even more distinct. The newly proposed SOA MM is then used to help the participating organizations position themselves in respect to SOA (current status), guide them to achieve higher levels of SOA maturity, and anticipate their SOA maturity in five years’ time. Furthermore, the “local” or “global” nature of the proposed SOA MM is investigated. This is checked firstly against selected expert panel participants and secondly against local business practitioners.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Zui5BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":104,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Zui5BAAAQBAJ&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Zui5BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=75&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781576100448","title":"Kick Ass Delphi Programming","author":"Don Taylor, John Penman, Jim Mischel, Terence Goggin","publish_date":"1996","description":"If you're seriously interested in taking Borland's 32-bit visual development environment to its extremes and beyond, then KickAss Delphi Programming is your guide.

In particular, the workshop promotes the discussion and exchange of ideas concerning the techniques, concepts, - quirements, and principles that are important for establishing multi-agent p- gramming platforms that are useful in practice and have a theoretically sound basis. Topics addressed include but are not limited to the theory and app- cations of agent programming languages, the veri?cation and analysis of agent systems,aswellastheimplementationofsocialstructureinagent-basedsystems (e. g. ,roleswithin organizations,coordinationandcommunicationin multi-agent systems).

All contributions were especially commissioned with a view to e- cidating a major multidisciplinary topic that is of concern to both academics and practitioners. The focus of the book is on expert judgment and its interaction with decision support systems. In the first part, the nature of expertise is discussed and characteristics of expert judges are described. Issues concemed with the eval- tion of judgment in the psychological laboratory are assessed and contrasted with studies of expert judgment in ecologically valid contexts. In addition, issues concerned with eliciting and validating expert knowledge are discussed. Dem- strations of good judgmental performance are linked to situational factors such as feedback cycles, and measurement of coherence and reliability in expert ju- ment is introduced as a baseline determinant of good judgmental performance. Issues concerned with the representation of elicited expert knowledge in kno- edge-based systems are evaluated and methods are described that have been shown to produce improvements in judgmental performance. Behavioral and mathematical ways of combining judgments from multiple experts are compared and contrasted. Finally, the issues developed in the preceding contributions are focused on current controversies in decision support. Expert judgment is utilized as a major input into decision analysis, forecasting with statistical models, and expert s- tems.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o3iPEMhKUhIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":273,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o3iPEMhKUhIC&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o3iPEMhKUhIC&pg=PA170&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=159&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9789051992731","title":"Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems: Proceedings of the Second International Workshop, June 26-28, 1996, Amsterdam, The Netherlands","author":"A.

Take Control of Your Project in the Final Stage of Software Development In software development, projects are won or lost during the project endgame—that final stage of software development between release for testing and release to customers. Software Endgames: Eliminating Defects, Controlling Change, and the Countdown to On-Time Delivery presents the core strategies for delivering working software to your customers. Focusing solely on the endgame, the book provides hard-won, hands-on strategies and practices for delivering real value. In the endgame, effective management and repair of defects is crucial. Experienced project manager and consultant Robert Galen shows readers how to conduct effective defect triage -- analyzing, understanding, and categorizing defects—in preparation for scheduling repairs. Readers will learn how to transform the endgame from a time of rampant defects and utter chaos into a time of focused repairs, effective teamwork, and change management. You'll set release criteria, establish endgame release plans, and utilize a variety of change reduction and endgame management techniques. Topics include developing various forms of release criteria and leveraging them to guide your teams' efforts strategies for reducing the rate of change change control and triage techniques that lead to efficient and effective defect repair decisions alternative methods of defect repair for decision-making flexibility setting up a defect-tracking system, managing defects and gathering standard metrics for endgame defect trending techniques for repair planning and efficiency agile extensions -- how to apply these techniques to agile projects how to \"mine\" your endgames for overall software development improvements","publisher":"Addison-Wesley","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0VcUAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":328,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0VcUAAAAQBAJ&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0VcUAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA214&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=167&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780122095511","title":"The Laboratory Computer: A Practical Guide for Physiologists and Neuroscientists","author":"John Dempster","publish_date":"2001","description":"The Laboratory Computer: A Practical Guide for Physiologists and Neuroscientists introduces the reader to both the basic principles and the actual practice of recording physiological signals using the computer.

The book presents an almost encyclopedic treatise of the facets, concepts and theories that have influenced knowledge management and the state of practice concerning strategy, organization, systems and economics. The second edition updates the material to cover the most recent developments in ICT-supported knowledge management. The book particularly provides a more in-depth coverage of its theoretical foundation including a new account of knowledge work, discusses the potentials and challenges of process-oriented knowledge management, adds a new chapter on modelling that plays an important role in knowledge management initiatives and contrasts architectures for centralized and distributed or peer-to-peer knowledge management systems.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IQD8JCxsEyEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":635,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":4,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IQD8JCxsEyEC&pg=PA387&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=184&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781439828328","title":"Advanced Manufacturing.

Current developments are focusing on both vehicle platform and diverse assistance systems. This book presents a new engineering approach based on lean vehicle architecture ready for the drive-by-wire technology. Based on a cognitive functionality split, execution and command levels are detailed. The execution level centralized over the stability control performs the motion vector coming from the command level. At this level the driver generates a motion vector which is continuously monitored by a virtual co-pilot. The integration of assistance systems in a safety relevant multi-agent system is presented here to provide first an adequate feedback to the driver to let him recover a dangerous situation. Robust strategies are also presented for the intervention phase once the command vehicle has to be optimized to stay within the safety envelope.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iD1GEDWooGsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":225,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iD1GEDWooGsC&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iD1GEDWooGsC&pg=PA185&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=193&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781447140610","title":"A Neural Network Approach to Fluid Quantity Measurement in Dynamic Environments","author":"Edin Terzic, Jenny Terzic, Romesh Nagarajah, Muhammad Alamgir","publish_date":"2012-04-28","description":"Sloshing causes liquid to fluctuate, making accurate level readings difficult to obtain in dynamic environments. The measurement system described uses a single-tube capacitive sensor to obtain an instantaneous level reading of the fluid surface, thereby accurately determining the fluid quantity in the presence of slosh. A neural network based classification technique has been applied to predict the actual quantity of the fluid contained in a tank under sloshing conditions. In A neural network approach to fluid quantity measurement in dynamic environments, effects of temperature variations and contamination on the capacitive sensor are discussed, and the authors propose that these effects can also be eliminated with the proposed neural network based classification system. To examine the performance of the classification system, many field trials were carried out on a running vehicle at various tank volume levels that range from 5 L to 50 L. The effectiveness of signal enhancement on the neural network based signal classification system is also investigated. Results obtained from the investigation are compared with traditionally used statistical averaging methods, and proves that the neural network based measurement system can produce highly accurate fluid quantity measurements in a dynamic environment. Although in this case a capacitive sensor was used to demonstrate measurement system this methodology is valid for all types of electronic sensors. The approach demonstrated in A neural network approach to fluid quantity measurement in dynamic environments can be applied to a wide range of fluid quantity measurement applications in the automotive, naval and aviation industries to produce accurate fluid level readings. Students, lecturers, and experts will find the description of current research about accurate fluid level measurement in dynamic environments using neural network approach useful.","publisher":"Springer","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JGMaswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":140,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JGMaswEACAAJ&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=194&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9788804541479","title":"Delphi 2006.

Im November 2006 wurden die Entwicklerteams der Entwicklungswerkzeuge, darunter auch Delphi, von Borland in eine neue Tochtergesellschaft namens CodeGear ausgegliedert. Am 7. Mai 2008 wurde die IDE-Sparte an Embarcadero Technologies verkauft. Die Sprache Delphi entwickelte sich zun chst unter dem Namen Object Pascal. Borland benannte Object Pascal 2003 in Delphi-Language um, mit der Begr ndung, dass sich bereits so viel in der Sprache ver ndert habe, dass man es nicht mehr mit Pascal gleichsetzen k nne. So wurden zum Beispiel viele origin re Konstrukte, wie sie von Niklaus Wirth f r Pascal als Programmiersprache zu Schulungszwecken erdacht worden sind (wie eine absolut strenge Typisierung), durch die aus der Praxis resultierenden Erfordernisse erg nzt.

Drawn from the findings of an award-winning thesis, Managing the Insider Threat: No Dark Corners is the first comprehensive resource to use social science research to explain why traditional methods fail against these trust betrayers. In this groundbreaking book, author Nick Catrantzos identifies new management, security, and workplace strategies for categorizing and defeating insider threats. The book begins with problem definition and research findings that lead to the \"No Dark Corners\" strategy for addressing insider threats. With these foundational underpinnings, the book then examines agents of change within the workplace—namely, key players in positions to effectively support or undermine the No Dark Corners strategy, including corporate sentinels and leaders affecting application of this approach. From there, the author goes on to examine key areas where No Dark Corners-style engagement can make a difference in the way an institution counters insider threats—through rethinking background investigations, recognizing deception, and using lawful disruption. Moving progressively from the theoretical to the practical in applying the strategy within an organizational framework, the book looks at implementation challenges and offers a framework for introducing new insider defense insights into an organization. Each chapter offers questions to stimulate discussion and exercises or problems suitable for team projects. This practical resource enables those charged with protecting an organization from internal threats to circumvent these predators before they jeopardize the workplace and sabotage business operations.","publisher":"CRC Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kyFIgGGDv2QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":363,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kyFIgGGDv2QC&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kyFIgGGDv2QC&printsec=frontcover&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=212&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9785826815984","title":"Ч. 1.

Excerpt: Oxygene (formerly known as Chrome) is a programming language developed by RemObjects Software for the Common Language Infrastructure. Oxygene is Object Pascal-based. Compared to the now deprecated Delphi.NET, Oxygene does not emphasize total backward compatibility, but is designed to be a full .NET citizen and leverage all the features and technologies provided by the .NET runtime. Starting 2008, RemObjects Software has licensed its compiler and IDE technology to Embarcadero to be used in their Delphi Prism product. Delphi Prism offers full integration into Visual Studio 2005/2008/2010. If the user doesn't have Visual Studio installed, Oxygene's setup includes the Visual Studio 2008 Shell. The Oxygene language has its origins in Object Pascal in general and Delphi in particular, but was designed to reflect the guidelines of .NET programming and to create fully CLR-compliant assemblies. Therefore not all language features known from Object Pascal / Delphi can be found any longer in Oxygene or only as legacy features. Oxygene is an object-oriented language, which means it uses classes, which can hold data and execute code, to design programs. Classes are \"prototypes\" for objects, like the idea of an apple is the prototype for the apple you can actually buy in the shop. You know that an apple has a color, and you know that it can be peeled: those are the data and executable \"code\" for the apple class. Oxygene provides language-level support for some of features of parallel programming. The goal is to use all cores or p...","publisher":"Books LLC, Wiki Series","image_url":null,"total_pages":32,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OuSOSQAACAAJ&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=214&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"Categorizing Tri-County K-12 Computer Education Course Goals by Means of a Delphi Process","author":"Richard Douglas Ricketts","publish_date":"1985","description":null,"publisher":null,"image_url":null,"total_pages":268,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pucKOAAACAAJ&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=215&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"搞定(Coding) Pascal程式語言 Lazarus: ","author":"吳正光","publish_date":"2015-02-26","description":"本書希望能以深入淺出的方式，讓讀者從基礎的Pascal語言學起，漸漸地進入到Delphi XE程式設計的精髓。首先，基礎的程式設計課程，以學習免費的Lazarus程式設計為主，而進階課程部份，再進入Delphi XE程式設計的領域。相信Pascal語言，會像是Lazarus一樣，死而復生，這就是撰寫本書的目的。","publisher":"Strategic Thinking","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RDjOBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":129,"written_language":"zh-CN","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RDjOBgAAQBAJ&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RDjOBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA15&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=216&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780079136527","title":"The Object Developer's Professional Reference","author":"Bill Green","publish_date":"1997-10-01","description":"Object technology is seen everywhere in computing, so every software developer now has to be an object developer.

The big data range from data mining, data analysis and decision making, by drawing statistical rules and mathematical patterns through systematical or automatically reasoning. The big data helps serve our life better, clarify our future and deliver greater value. We can discover how to capture and analyze data. Readers will be guided to processing system integrity and implementing intelligent systems. With intelligent systems, we deal with the fundamental data management and visualization challenges in effective management of dynamic and large-scale data, and efficient processing of real-time and spatio-temporal data. Advanced intelligent systems have led to managing the data monitoring, data processing and decision-making in realistic and effective way. Considering a big size of data, variety of data and frequent changes of data, the intelligent systems basically challenge new data management tasks for integration, visualization, querying and analysis. Connected with powerful data analysis, the intelligent systems will provide a paradigm shift from conventional store and process systems. This book focuses on taking a full advantage of big data and intelligent systems processing. It consists of 11 contributions that feature extraction of minority opinion, method for reusing an application, assessment of scientific and innovative projects, multi-voxel pattern analysis, exploiting No-SQL DB, materialized view, TF-IDF criterion, latent Dirichlet allocation, technology forecasting, small world network, and classification & regression tree structure.

The logistical plan used in BCP is called a business continuity plan. The intended effect of BCP is to ensure business continuity, which is an ongoing state or methodology governing how business is conducted. In plain language, BCP is working out how to stay in business in the event of disaster. Typical incidents include local events like building fires, regional incidents like earthquakes or floods, or national incidents like pandemic illnesses. However, it is not limited to just that. Any event that could cause the potential for loss of business should be considered, including any event that the business is dependent on, such as loss of source of supply, loss of critical infrastructure (a major piece of machinery or computing/network resource), or the result of theft or vandalism. This book is your ultimate resource for Business continuity planning (BCP). Here you will find the most up-to-date information, analysis, background and everything you need to know.

Object-orientation, application servers, web front-ends, and relational database systems dominate the scene for new projects today. The fact remains however, that millions of lines of source code written in the structured programming language COBOL work daily on computer systems all over the world. One problem that COBOL developers have to deal with on these new projects is familiarity with object-oriented concepts. Markus Knasmüller, rich with experiences of OO projects in COBOL development teams, offers a successful introduction for the experienced COBOL programmer. A careful approach across techniques familiar to COBOL developers and discussions of current standards make this book easily accessible and understandable. *A practical approach to OOP using the concepts and techniques familiar to the experienced COBOL programmer. *Written independently from any specific programming environment, and all programming examples written in both Delphi and Java. *Detailed case study describing the successful migration of 10 million lines of COBOL code to object-oriented programming. *Companion CD-ROM containing all tutorial sections of the book in PowerPoint and all sample solutions to the problems ready for compilation.","publisher":"Morgan Kaufmann","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=c5n_-J4rG30C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":342,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c5n_-J4rG30C&printsec=frontcover&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=229&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781556225673","title":"Learn Pascal in Three Days","author":"Sam A.

The book takes you inside the interesting stories and people behind this unique, underdog computer. Both noted computer science and technology advocates, authors Pitre and Loguidice reveal the story of a pivotal period in the home computing revolution from the perspective of Tandy’s CoCo. As these computers were sold in Radio Shack stores throughout the United States and other countries, they provide a critical point of reference for key events in the unprecedented evolutionary period for the PC industry in the 1980s. The book also features first-hand accounts from the people who created and promoted the CoCo, from the original Tandy executives and engineers to today’s active product creators and information keepers. The CoCo impacted many lives, and this book leaves no stone unturned in recounting this fascinating slice of the PC revolution that is still in play today. From early telecommunications experiments to engineering and budgetary challenges, it covers all the aspects that made the CoCo a truly personal, useful computing experience in as small and inexpensive a package as possible.","publisher":"CRC Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=k5bNBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":203,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k5bNBQAAQBAJ&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":2,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k5bNBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA155&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=248&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9783540760528","title":"Essential Java Fast: How to Write Object Oriented Software for the Internet in Java","author":"John Cowell","publish_date":"1997-02-18","description":"This book provides a readable introduction to the Java programming language, enabling readers to develop their own programs quickly and easily.

Much work went into preparing a program of high quality. We received about 972 submissions. Every paper was reviewed by 3 program committee members, about 382 were selected as regular papers, representing a 39% acceptance rate for regular papers. The CCCM conferences serve as good platforms for the engineering community to meet with each other and to exchange ideas. The conference has also stroke a balance between theoretical and application development. The conference committees have been formed with over two hundred committee members who are mainly research center heads, faculty deans, department heads, professors, and research scientists from over 30 countries. The conferences are truly international meetings with a high level of participation from many countries. The response that we have received for the congress is excellent.

As a result large amounts of time and money are often wasted on inappropriate and inefficient systems. The cost of retraining and reorganising can also be prohibitive if the new technology does not deliver the desired results. In a business environment where technology is of increasing importance, the non-technical manager cannot afford to remain in the dark. Technology in Context provides a toolkit of approaches to this difficult subject. Subjects covered include: * the fundamental concepts required for the management of technology * the gathering of information in a firm to support strategic decisions on technology * technology assessment in the public domain * the wider social implications of technology * problems associated with technology, from the danger of environmental degradation to employment and skills.","publisher":"Routledge","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vcu_O15sAb4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":176,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vcu_O15sAb4C&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vcu_O15sAb4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=252&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"Visual Basic Components Sourcebook for Developers","author":"Jeffrey P.

This publication provides a forum for the examination of the problem. It aims to focus the efforts of researchers and practitioners more effectively in applying information technology to increase the performance of decision makers in public administration despite the limited resources. Topics explored include the following: design considerations and approaches for, and practical experiences with, communication and information processing infrastructure and applications at the workplace level; the design and implementation of support systems for individual or group decision making in governmental and municipal settings; modelling and model management techniques, based on case reports of successful and unsuccessful modelling efforts; concepts, approaches and models for re-designing tasks and processes in public administration; issues and challenges in integrating the information systems of several governmental bodies. The book is divided into two parts for the discussion of these themes - the first section deals primarily with theoretical and conceptual issues; the second part contains papers with a stronger emphasis on systems, their functionality and experiences in their development and application. The authors' affiliations (17 organizations from 8 different countries) indicates the international nature of the contributions. The ideas put forward in their papers show that research into supporting decision making in public administration is well on its way but that the research area is vast, with yet many hills to scale.","publisher":"North Holland","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ghIZAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":200,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ghIZAQAAIAAJ&q=delphi,+subject:computers&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=255&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"A Fifteen-year Forecast of Information Processing Technology","author":"George B.

This group was made up of more than 45 of the top names from government, industry, and academia. Round II was a direct application of the normative approach. It should be stressed that Round I (last year's effort) was an attempt to provide a data base; whereas, Round II was an attempt to refine, extend, and structure the data base to enhance the value of this forecast for planning and system design personnel. After receiving the inputs from the panel of Round II experts, a refined list of potential events was produced. This list was used to develop a menu of alternative potential short-, mid-, and long-range goals; and to identify supporting events which may be desirable or even necessary to make these goals achievable. A relevance display technique was used to document alternative pathways from the current state-of-the-art to where it will be in the future.

In four parts the 22 essays take up designing hypertext and hypermedia systems for the online user; textual intervention and collaboration; new roles for writers; and sensemaking and learning in the online environment.In his introduction, Barrett analyzes the design of networked online systems as part of a collaborative process, asserting that the online environment fosters collaboration by using computer technology to support interaction among those who design, use, and write software.The first five essays present a genealogy of hypertext development, assess various hypertext designs, discuss users' wants and needs, and analyze the \"rhetoric\" of hypertext applications in light of new models for computer human interaction. Seven essays then take up new, important online systems for information retrieval, document production, and training in the online environment. Included are a first time full scale analysis of the Athena Muse hypermedia system developed at MIT, the hypertext environment Intermedia, developed at Brown, the University of Maryland's Hyperties, and the Educational Online System for document production and training technical writers, now in its second year of use at MIT.New roles for writers and productivity gains provided by online environments are the subject of the next six essays. The final four essays discuss instructional efficiency and the failures of instructional materials. Novel proposals are described for addressing the needs and strategies of learners, for supporting cooperative work in creating, revising, and testing a software program, for evaluating online help systems, and for eliminating ambiguity in online text.Edward Barrett is Lecturer in the Writing Program at MIT.

The recent surge in online community participation has become a cultural phenomenon enmeshed in ongoing debates about the health of American civil society. But observations about online communities often concentrate on ascertaining the true nature of community and democracy, typically rehearsing familiar communitarian and liberal perspectives. This book seeks to understand the technology on its own terms, focusing on how the technological and organizational configurations of online communities frame our contemporary beliefs and assumptions about community and the individual. It analyzes key structural features of thirty award-winning online community websites to show that while the values of individual autonomy, egalitarianism, and freedom of speech dominate the discursive content of these communities, the practical realities of online life are clearly marked by exclusivity and the demands of commercialization and corporate surveillance. Promises of social empowerment are framed within consumer and therapeutic frameworks that undermine their democratic efficacy. As a result, online communities fail to revolutionize the civic landscape because they create cultures of membership that epitomize the commodification of community and public life altogether.","publisher":"Peter Lang Pub Inc","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UnkSAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":178,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UnkSAQAAMAAJ&q=delphi,+subject:computers&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=277&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"The Internet for A/E's: a guidebook for architects, engineers and other design professionals","author":"Guidelines (Firm)","publish_date":"1995","description":null,"publisher":null,"image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=O_U2AQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":140,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O_U2AQAAIAAJ&q=delphi,+subject:computers&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=278&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780471113546","title":"Online Resources for Business: Getting the Information Your Business Needs to Stay Competitive","author":"Alfred Glossbrenner, John Rosenberg","publish_date":"1995-09-22","description":"Create a search strategy that will save you time and money——every time you go online!

LINQ is one of the most exciting and powerful development technologies Microsoft has introduced in many years. In this book, two Microsoft insiders share their intimate understanding of LINQ, revealing new patterns and best practices for making the most of it. Charlie Calvert and Dinesh Kulkarni clearly explain how LINQ resolves the long-time 'impedance mismatch' between the object-oriented code programmers write and the relational databases they need to access. Next, they show how LINQ integrates querying into C# as a 'first class citizen.' Using realistic code examples, they show how LINQ gives developers a stronglytyped, IntelliSense-aware technology they can use to work with data no matter where it is - in SQL databases, XML files, or in generic data structures such as Lists and Queues. Readers will learn how to extend LINQ to reach virtually any alternative data source. Drawing on their experience as members of Microsoft's LINQ and C# teams, Calvert and Kulkarni carefully explain the three concepts at LINQ's core: LINQ as transformative, composable, and declarative. By fully explaining the full meaning and importance of these concepts, the authors liberate developers to exploit LINQ's full power as never before. While this book focuses on LINQ development with C#, a full chapter on LINQ and Visual Basic makes this book even more widely accessible and useful.","publisher":"Addison-Wesley Professional","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wBA-mAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":564,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wBA-mAEACAAJ&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=288&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"The Internet Unplugged: Utilities & Techniques for Internet Productivity...online and Off","author":"Michael A.

Reilly","publish_date":"1996-01-01","description":"Windows® 95 places a powerful 32-bit client on millions of desktops, and Windows NT is fast becoming a great server platform -- but NetWare's showing no signs of vanishing. As an architect of client/server systems you need to know how to write to the strengths of each platform and maximize your use of corresponding protocols and available tools. Win32 Client/Server Developer's Guide is an essential guide to client/server technologies, tools, and strategies for developing distributed Windows applications. Beginning with a grounding in what client/server is and the best uses for it, the book proceeds to discuss how the client should pass requests on to the server, how the properly designed server handles processing requests, and how to improve performance through the use of a file retrieval system like Btrieve. The book moves on to cover: Win32 options to consider when the client is waiting, using SQL and ODBC to gain access to a variety of data sources, integrating legacy systems, IBM AS/400 minicomputers or IBM mainframes, incorporating NetWare into the mix, with insight into the daunting task of creating a NetWare Loadable Module (NLM) based server, applying Named Pipes, Windows Sockets, and RPC to client/server communications, using C/C++ tools versus development environments such as Visual Basic, Delphi, and PowerBuilder, and the steps required to encapsulate ODBC operations within a set of C++ classes. The final chapters apply client/server Win32 programming techniques to the specific tasks involved in creating a program, and discuss such critical topics as how to control the behavior of a system at runtime through use of a generic DLL that links at runtime to the appropriate network specific DLL. The disk contains source code from examples and the book's API that can be used as a network-independent intermediary layer between client and server. Readers can use this API as provided or customize it for use within their own projects. 0201407620B04062001","publisher":"Addison-Wesley","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PtxQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":460,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PtxQAAAAMAAJ&q=delphi,+subject:computers&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=312&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780810452206","title":"The electronic mailbox","author":"Ira Mayer","publish_date":"1985-11-01","description":null,"publisher":"Hayden Books","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cXcqAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":198,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cXcqAQAAIAAJ&q=delphi,+subject:computers&dq=delphi,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=313&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780130200914","title":"Software Engineering with Oracle: Best Practices for Mission-critical Systems","author":"Elio Bonazzi","publish_date":"2000","description":"Bonazzi shows how to conduct Oracle projects from a software engineering prospective, illustrating the typical Oracle SDLC (software development life cycle).
