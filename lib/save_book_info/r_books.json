Berger (2000) documents the increase in Bayesian activity by the number of published research articles, the number of books,andtheextensivenumberofapplicationsofBayesianarticlesinapplied disciplines such as science and engineering. One reason for the dramatic growth in Bayesian modeling is the availab- ity of computational algorithms to compute the range of integrals that are necessary in a Bayesian posterior analysis. Due to the speed of modern c- puters, it is now possible to use the Bayesian paradigm to ?t very complex models that cannot be ?t by alternative frequentist methods. To ?t Bayesian models, one needs a statistical computing environment. This environment should be such that one can: write short scripts to de?ne a Bayesian model use or write functions to summarize a posterior distribution use functions to simulate from the posterior distribution construct graphs to illustrate the posterior inference An environment that meets these requirements is the R system. R provides a wide range of functions for data manipulation, calculation, and graphical d- plays. Moreover, it includes a well-developed, simple programming language that users can extend by adding new functions. Many such extensions of the language in the form of packages are easily downloadable from the Comp- hensive R Archive Network (CRAN).","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AALhk_mt7SYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":300,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AALhk_mt7SYC&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":1.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AALhk_mt7SYC&pg=PA235&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780387781716","title":"Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R","author":"Roger S.

Faraway","publish_date":"2016-02-10","description":"Linear models are central to the practice of statistics and form the foundation of a vast range of statistical methodologies. Julian J. Faraway's critically acclaimed Linear Models with R examined regression and analysis of variance, demonstrated the different methods available, and showed in which situations each one applies. Following in those footsteps, Extending the Linear Model with R surveys the techniques that grow from the regression model, presenting three extensions to that framework: generalized linear models (GLMs), mixed effect models, and nonparametric regression models. The author's treatment is thoroughly modern and covers topics that include GLM diagnostics, generalized linear mixed models, trees, and even the use of neural networks in statistics. To demonstrate the interplay of theory and practice, throughout the book the author weaves the use of the R software environment to analyze the data of real examples, providing all of the R commands necessary to reproduce the analyses.

While most applications concern biology, morphometrics is becoming common tools used in archeological, palaeontological, geographical, or medicine disciplines. Since the recent formalizations of some of the ideas of predecessors, such as D’arcy Thompson, and thanks to the development of computer techno- gies and new ways for appraising shape changes and variation, morphometrics have undergone, and are still undergoing, a revolution. Most techniques dealing with s- tistical shape analysis have been developed in the last three decades, and the number of publications using morphometrics is increasing rapidly. However, the majority of these methods cannot be implemented in available software and therefore prosp- tive students often need to acquire detailed knowledge in informatics and statistics before applying them to their data.

Computation provides access to information in text that we simply cannot gather using traditional qualitative methods of close reading and human synthesis. Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature provides a practical introduction to computational text analysis using the open source programming language R. R is extremely popular throughout the sciences and because of its accessibility, R is now used increasingly in other research areas. Readers begin working with text right away and each chapter works through a new technique or process such that readers gain a broad exposure to core R procedures and a basic understanding of the possibilities of computational text analysis at both the micro and macro scale. Each chapter builds on the previous as readers move from small scale “microanalysis” of single texts to large scale “macroanalysis” of text corpora, and each chapter concludes with a set of practice exercises that reinforce and expand upon the chapter lessons. The book’s focus is on making the technical palatable and making the technical useful and immediately gratifying.","publisher":"Springer","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K4_IAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":194,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K4_IAwAAQBAJ&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K4_IAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=20&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781593273842","title":"The Art of R Programming: A Tour of Statistical Software Design","author":"Norman Matloff","publish_date":"2011","description":"A guide to software development using the R programming language covers such topics as closures, recursion, anonymous functions, and debugging techniques.","publisher":"No Starch Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o2aLBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":400,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o2aLBAAAQBAJ&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":12,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o2aLBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=21&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781461443438","title":"R for Business Analytics","author":"A Ohri","publish_date":"2012-09-14","description":"R for Business Analytics looks at some of the most common tasks performed by business analysts and helps the user navigate the wealth of information in R and its 4000 packages. With this information the reader can select the packages that can help process the analytical tasks with minimum effort and maximum usefulness. The use of Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) is emphasized in this book to further cut down and bend the famous learning curve in learning R. This book is aimed to help you kick-start with analytics including chapters on data visualization, code examples on web analytics and social media analytics, clustering, regression models, text mining, data mining models and forecasting. The book tries to expose the reader to a breadth of business analytics topics without burying the user in needless depth. The included references and links allow the reader to pursue business analytics topics. This book is aimed at business analysts with basic programming skills for using R for Business Analytics. Note the scope of the book is neither statistical theory nor graduate level research for statistics, but rather it is for business analytics practitioners. Business analytics (BA) refers to the field of exploration and investigation of data generated by businesses. Business Intelligence (BI) is the seamless dissemination of information through the organization, which primarily involves business metrics both past and current for the use of decision support in businesses. Data Mining (DM) is the process of discovering new patterns from large data using algorithms and statistical methods. To differentiate between the three, BI is mostly current reports, BA is models to predict and strategize and DM matches patterns in big data. The R statistical software is the fastest growing analytics platform in the world, and is established in both academia and corporations for robustness, reliability and accuracy. The book utilizes Albert Einstein’s famous remarks on making things as simple as possible, but no simpler. This book will blow the last remaining doubts in your mind about using R in your business environment. Even non-technical users will enjoy the easy-to-use examples. The interviews with creators and corporate users of R make the book very readable. The author firmly believes Isaac Asimov was a better writer in spreading science than any textbook or journal author.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=D2Su4qomE4sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":312,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=D2Su4qomE4sC&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=D2Su4qomE4sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=22&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9783642178412","title":"Chemometrics with R: Multivariate Data Analysis in the Natural Sciences and Life Sciences","author":"Ron Wehrens","publish_date":"2011-01-20","description":"\"Chemometrics with R\" offers readers an accessible introduction to the world of multivariate statistics in the life sciences, providing a complete description of the general data analysis paradigm, from exploratory analysis to modeling to validation.

Accordingly, the use of databases in R is covered in detail, along with methods for extracting data from spreadsheets and datasets created by other programs. Character manipulation, while sometimes overlooked within R, is also covered in detail, allowing problems that are traditionally solved by scripting languages to be carried out entirely within R. For users with experience in other languages, guidelines for the effective use of programming constructs like loops are provided.

It also presents a detailed description of available software implementations in R. The R packages and source code for the analyses are available at http://CRAN.R-project.org After giving examples of multiplicity problems, the book covers general concepts and basic multiple comparisons procedures, including the Bonferroni method and Simes’ test. It then shows how to perform parametric multiple comparisons in standard linear models and general parametric models. It also introduces the multcomp package in R, which offers a convenient interface to perform multiple comparisons in a general context. Following this theoretical framework, the book explores applications involving the Dunnett test, Tukey’s all pairwise comparisons, and general multiple contrast tests for standard regression models, mixed-effects models, and parametric survival models. The last chapter reviews other multiple comparison procedures, such as resampling-based procedures, methods for group sequential or adaptive designs, and the combination of multiple comparison procedures with modeling techniques. Controlling multiplicity in experiments ensures better decision making and safeguards against false claims. A self-contained introduction to multiple comparison procedures, this book offers strategies for constructing the procedures and illustrates the framework for multiple hypotheses testing in general parametric models. It is suitable for readers with R experience but limited knowledge of multiple comparison procedures and vice versa.

Numerous examples, case studies, and exercises are included. R is used to simplify computation, create figures, and draw pseudorandom samples—not to perform entire analyses. After discussing the importance of chance in experimentation, the text develops basic tools of probability. The plug-in principle then provides a transition from populations to samples, motivating a variety of summary statistics and diagnostic techniques. The heart of the text is a careful exposition of point estimation, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals. The author then explains procedures for 1- and 2-sample location problems, analysis of variance, goodness-of-fit, and correlation and regression. He concludes by discussing the role of simulation in modern statistical inference. Focusing on the assumptions that underlie popular statistical methods, this textbook explains how and why these methods are used to analyze experimental data.","publisher":"CRC Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XPgDTUkus_IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":496,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XPgDTUkus_IC&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XPgDTUkus_IC&printsec=frontcover&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=56&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781493909834","title":"Statistical Analysis of Network Data with R","author":"Eric D.

These units might be human subjects, archaeological artifacts, countries, or a vast variety of other things. In a few cases, it may be sensible to isolate each variable and study it separately, but in most instances all the variables need to be examined simultaneously in order to fully grasp the structure and key features of the data. For this purpose, one or another method of multivariate analysis might be helpful, and it is with such methods that this book is largely concerned. Multivariate analysis includes methods both for describing and exploring such data and for making formal inferences about them. The aim of all the techniques is, in general sense, to display or extract the signal in the data in the presence of noise and to find out what the data show us in the midst of their apparent chaos. An Introduction to Applied Multivariate Analysis with R explores the correct application of these methods so as to extract as much information as possible from the data at hand, particularly as some type of graphical representation, via the R software. Throughout the book, the authors give many examples of R code used to apply the multivariate techniques to multivariate data.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BB51TWe94EwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":274,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BB51TWe94EwC&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BB51TWe94EwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=59&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781402086236","title":"A Practical Guide to Ecological Modelling: Using R as a Simulation Platform","author":"Karline Soetaert, Peter M. J. Herman","publish_date":"2008-10-21","description":"Mathematical modelling is an essential tool in present-day ecological research. Yet for many ecologists it is still problematic to apply modelling in their research. In our experience, the major problem is at the conceptual level: proper understanding of what a model is, how ecological relations can be translated consistently into mathematical equations, how models are solved, steady states calculated and interpreted. Many textbooks jump over these conceptual hurdles to dive into detailed formulations or the mathematics of solution. This book attempts to fill that gap. It introduces essential concepts for mathematical modelling, explains the mathematics behind the methods, and helps readers to implement models and obtain hands-on experience. Throughout the book, emphasis is laid on how to translate ecological questions into interpretable models in a practical way. The book aims to be an introductory textbook at the undergraduate-graduate level, but will also be useful to seduce experienced ecologists into the world of modelling. The range of ecological models treated is wide, from Lotka-Volterra type of principle-seeking models to environmental or ecosystem models, and including matrix models, lattice models and sequential decision models. All chapters contain a concise introduction into the theory, worked-out examples and exercises. All examples are implemented in the open-source package R, thus taking away problems of software availability for use of the book. All code used in the book is available on a dedicated website.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aVjDtSmJqhAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":372,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aVjDtSmJqhAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=60&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781439831649","title":"Event History Analysis with R","author":"Göran Broström","publish_date":"2012-04-03","description":"With an emphasis on social science applications, Event History Analysis with R presents an introduction to survival and event history analysis using real-life examples.

In response to this, Statistical Computing in C++ and R concentrates on the writing of code rather than the development and study of numerical algorithms per se. The book discusses code development in C++ and R and the use of these symbiotic languages in unison. It emphasizes that each offers distinct features that, when used in tandem, can take code writing beyond what can be obtained from either language alone. The text begins with some basics of object-oriented languages, followed by a \"boot-camp\" on the use of C++ and R. The authors then discuss code development for the solution of specific computational problems that are relevant to statistics including optimization, numerical linear algebra, and random number generation. Later chapters introduce abstract data structures (ADTs) and parallel computing concepts. The appendices cover R and UNIX Shell programming. Features Includes numerous student exercises ranging from elementary to challenging Integrates both C++ and R for the solution of statistical computing problems Uses C++ code in R and R functions in C++ programs Provides downloadable programs, available from the authors’ website The translation of a mathematical problem into its computational analog (or analogs) is a skill that must be learned, like any other, by actively solving relevant problems.

Paul Murrell, widely known as the leading expert on R graphics, has developed an in-depth resource that takes nothing for granted and helps both neophyte and seasoned users master the intricacies of R graphics. After an introductory overview of R graphics facilities, the presentation first focuses on the traditional graphics system, showing how to work the traditional functions, describing functions that are available to produce complete plots, and how to customize the details of plots. The second part of the book describes the grid graphics system - a system unique to R and much more powerful than the traditional system. The author, who was integral in the development of the grid system, shows, starting from a blank page, how it can be used to produce graphical scenes. He also describes how to develop new graphical functions that are easy for others to use and build on. Appendices contain a brief introduction to the R system in general and discuss how the traditional and grid graphics systems can be combined. Much of the information presented in this book cannot be found anywhere else. Well ahead of the curve, particularly regarding the grid system, R Graphics will have a major impact on the future direction of statistical graphics development.

Over the past decade, a dizzying array of tools and methods were generated to incorporate phylogenetic and functional information into traditional ecological analyses. Increasingly these tools are implemented in R, thus greatly expanding their impact. Researchers getting started in R can use this volume as a step-by-step entryway into phylogenetic and functional analyses for ecology in R. More advanced users will be able to use this volume as a quick reference to understand particular analyses. The volume begins with an introduction to the R environment and handling relevant data in R. Chapters then cover phylogenetic and functional metrics of biodiversity; null modeling and randomizations for phylogenetic and functional trait analyses; integrating phylogenetic and functional trait information; and interfacing the R environment with a popular C-based program. This book presents a unique approach through its focus on ecological analyses and not macroevolutionary analyses. The author provides his own code, so that the reader is guided through the computational steps to calculate the desired metrics. This guided approach simplifies the work of determining which package to use for any given analysis. Example datasets are shared to help readers practice, and readers can then quickly turn to their own datasets.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ze63BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":212,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ze63BAAAQBAJ&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ze63BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=70&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780123869425","title":"Numerical Methods: Using MATLAB","author":"George R.

Containing over 40 exercises with model answers, this book will be welcomed by all linguists wishing to learn more about working with and presenting quantitative data.","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UvWkIg5E4foC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":null,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UvWkIg5E4foC&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":1.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UvWkIg5E4foC&printsec=frontcover&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=90&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781852338824","title":"An R and S-Plus® Companion to Multivariate Analysis","author":"Brian Everitt","publish_date":"2005-01-01","description":"Most data sets collected by researchers are multivariate, and in the majority of cases the variables need to be examined simultaneously to get the most informative results. This requires the use of one or other of the many methods of multivariate analysis, and the use of a suitable software package such as S-PLUS or R. In this book the core multivariate methodology is covered along with some basic theory for each method described. The necessary R and S-PLUS code is given for each analysis in the book, with any differences between the two highlighted. A website with all the datasets and code used in the book can be found at http://biostatistics.iop.kcl.ac.uk/publications/everitt/. Graduate students, and advanced undergraduates on applied statistics courses, especially those in the social sciences, will find this book invaluable in their work, and it will also be useful to researchers outside of statistics who need to deal with the complexities of multivariate data in their work.

Simple yet meaningful examples in R illustrate each step of the modeling process. The examples start from the simplest notions and gradually increase in complexity. The authors also distinguish the probabilistic models from their estimation with data sets. The first three chapters explain the whole process of Bayesian network modeling, from structure learning to parameter learning to inference. These chapters cover discrete Bayesian, Gaussian Bayesian, and hybrid networks, including arbitrary random variables. The book then gives a concise but rigorous treatment of the fundamentals of Bayesian networks and offers an introduction to causal Bayesian networks. It also presents an overview of R and other software packages appropriate for Bayesian networks. The final chapter evaluates two real-world examples: a landmark causal protein signaling network paper and graphical modeling approaches for predicting the composition of different body parts. Suitable for graduate students and non-statisticians, this text provides an introductory overview of Bayesian networks. It gives readers a clear, practical understanding of the general approach and steps involved.","publisher":"CRC Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v-XMAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":241,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v-XMAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=92&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781118332580","title":"Data Mining Algorithms: Explained Using R","author":"Pawel Cichosz","publish_date":"2015-01-27","description":"\"This book narrows down the scope of data mining by adopting a heavily modeling-oriented perspective\"--","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q7FYBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":720,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q7FYBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=93&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781466505995","title":"Applied Meta-Analysis with R","author":"Ding-Geng (Din) Chen, Karl E.

Filling this knowledge gap, Applied Meta-Analysis with R shows how to implement statistical meta-analysis methods to real data using R. Drawing on their extensive research and teaching experiences, the authors provide detailed, step-by-step explanations of the implementation of meta-analysis methods using R. Each chapter gives examples of real studies compiled from the literature. After presenting the data and necessary background for understanding the applications, various methods for analyzing meta-data are introduced. The authors then develop analysis code using the appropriate R packages and functions. This systematic approach helps readers thoroughly understand the analysis methods and R implementation, enabling them to use R and the methods to analyze their own meta-data. Suitable as a graduate-level text for a meta-data analysis course, the book is also a valuable reference for practitioners and biostatisticians (even those with little or no experience in using R) in public health, medical research, governmental agencies, and the pharmaceutical industry.","publisher":"CRC Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N28Sjf6A6jMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":342,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N28Sjf6A6jMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=94&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780465045662","title":"Metamagical Themas: Questing for the Essence of Mind and Pattern","author":"Douglas R.

Fortunately, the idea of 'quality management' is being reinvigorated. In the last decade process programs have become more and more prevalent. And, out of all the available options, three have moved to the top of the chain. These three are: The 9001:2000 Quality Management Standard from the International Standards Organization; The Capability Maturity Model Integration from the Software Engineering Institute; and Six Sigma, a methodology for improvement shaped by companies such as Motorola, Honeywell, and General Electric. These recognized and proven quality programs are rising in popularity as more technology managers are looking for ways to help remove degrees of risk and uncertainty from their business equations, and to introduce methods of predictability that better ensure success. Process Improvement Essentials combines the foundation needed to understand process improvement theory with the best practices to help individuals implement process improvement initiatives in their organization. The three leading programs: ISO 9001:2000, CMMI, and Six Sigma--amidst the buzz and hype--tend to get lumped together under a common label. This book delivers a combined guide to all three programs, compares their applicability, and then sets the foundation for further exploration. It's a one-stop-shop designed to give you a working orientation to what the field is all about.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4xDZPpsjknUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":352,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4xDZPpsjknUC&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":3.0,"ratings_count":3,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4xDZPpsjknUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=98&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9783528057992","title":"Efficient Sap R/3-Data Archiving: How to Handle Large Data Volumes","author":"Markus Korschen","publish_date":"2002","description":"This book is a practical guide for managing archiving projects with SAP R/3 efficiently.

Berger (2000) documents the increase in Bayesian activity by the number of published research articles, the number of books,andtheextensivenumberofapplicationsofBayesianarticlesinapplied disciplines such as science and engineering. One reason for the dramatic growth in Bayesian modeling is the availab- ity of computational algorithms to compute the range of integrals that are necessary in a Bayesian posterior analysis. Due to the speed of modern c- puters, it is now possible to use the Bayesian paradigm to ?t very complex models that cannot be ?t by alternative frequentist methods. To ?t Bayesian models, one needs a statistical computing environment. This environment should be such that one can: write short scripts to de?ne a Bayesian model use or write functions to summarize a posterior distribution use functions to simulate from the posterior distribution construct graphs to illustrate the posterior inference An environment that meets these requirements is the R system. R provides a wide range of functions for data manipulation, calculation, and graphical d- plays. Moreover, it includes a well-developed, simple programming language that users can extend by adding new functions. Many such extensions of the language in the form of packages are easily downloadable from the Comp- hensive R Archive Network (CRAN).","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AALhk_mt7SYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":300,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AALhk_mt7SYC&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":1.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AALhk_mt7SYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=101&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781589480346","title":"Arc Hydro: GIS for Water Resources","author":"David R.

The authors adopt a problem-driven approach, in which statistical and mathematical tools are introduced in the context of the forestry problem that they can help to resolve. All the tools are introduced in the context of real forestry datasets, which provide compelling examples of practical applications. The modeling challenges covered within the book include imputation and interpolation for spatial data, fitting probability density functions to tree measurement data using maximum likelihood, fitting allometric functions using both linear and non-linear least-squares regression, and fitting growth models using both linear and non-linear mixed-effects modeling. The coverage also includes deploying and using forest growth models written in compiled languages, analysis of natural resources and forestry inventory data, and forest estate planning and optimization using linear programming. The book would be ideal for a one-semester class in forest biometrics or applied statistics for natural resources management. The text assumes no programming background, some introductory statistics, and very basic applied mathematics.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z2m57dY4vgMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":354,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z2m57dY4vgMC&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z2m57dY4vgMC&pg=PA19&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=112&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780750679466","title":"Programming the PIC Microcontroller with MBASIC","author":"Jack R.

Hansen, Chris R. Johnson","publish_date":"2005","description":"Visualization involves constructing graphical interfaces that enable humans to understand complex data sets; it helps humans overcome their natural limitations in terms of extracting knowledge from the massive volumes of data that are now routinely connected. The best argument for scientific visualization is that today's researchers must consume ever higher volumes of numbers that gush, as if from a fire hose, out of supercomputer simulations or high-powered scientific instruments. If researchers try to read the data, usually presented as vast numeric matrices, they will take in the information at snail's pace. If the information is rendered graphically, however, they can assimilate it at a much faster rate Rapid advances in 3-D scientific visualization have made a major impact on the display of data/information. These advances have been supported by advances in computing power and graphics programming techniques, which combined have brought the tools of visualization to a multidisciplinary audience of both researchers and practitioners from all engineering disciplines, as well as the physical, social and life sciences. * Edited by two of the best known people in the world on the subject; chapter authors are authoritative experts in their own fields; * Covers a wide range of topics, in 47 chapters, representing the state-of-the-art of scientific visualization.","publisher":"Academic Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZFrlULckWdAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":962,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":3.5,"ratings_count":3,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZFrlULckWdAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=134&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780470280737","title":"Probability with R: an introduction with computer science applications","author":"Jane M. Horgan","publish_date":"2009","description":"A Complete Introduction to probability AND its computer Science Applications USING R Probability with R serves as a comprehensive and introductory book on probability with an emphasis on computing-related applications. Real examples show how probability can be used in practical situations, and the freely available and downloadable statistical programming language R illustrates and clarifies the book's main principles. Promoting a simulation- and experimentation-driven methodology, this book highlights the relationship between probability and computing in five distinctive parts: The R Language presents the essentials of the R language, including key procedures for summarizing and building graphical displays of statistical data. Fundamentals of Probability provides the foundations of the basic concepts of probability and moves into applications in computing. Topical coverage includes conditional probability, Bayes' theorem, system reliability, and the development of the main laws and properties of probability. Discrete Distributions addresses discrete random variables and their density and distribution functions as well as the properties of expectation. The geometric, binomial, hypergeometric, and Poisson distributions are also discussed and used to develop sampling inspection schemes. Continuous Distributions introduces continuous variables by examining the waiting time between Poisson occurrences. The exponential distribution and its applications to reliability are investigated, and the Markov property is illustrated via simulation in R. The normal distribution is examined and applied to statistical process control. Tailing Off delves into the use of Markov and Chebyshev inequalities as tools for estimating tail probabilities with limited information on the random variable. Numerous exercises and projects are provided in each chapter, many of which require the use of R to perform routine calculations and conduct experiments with simulated data. The author directs readers to the appropriate Web-based resources for installing the R software package and also supplies the essential commands for working in the R workspace. A related Web site features an active appendix as well as a forum for readers to share findings, thoughts, and ideas. With its accessible and hands-on approach, Probability with R is an ideal book for a first course in probability at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels for readers with a background in computer science, engineering, and the general sciences. It also serves as a valuable reference for computing professionals who would like to further understand the relevance of probability in their areas of practice.","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons Inc","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Mf0kAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":393,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mf0kAQAAIAAJ&q=r,+subject:computers&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=135&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781439884485","title":"Using R for Numerical Analysis in Science and Engineering","author":"Victor A.

This book is divided into two parts, an overview of security policies and procedures, and an information security reference guide. This volume points out how security documents and standards are key elements in the business process that should never be undertaken to satisfy a perceived audit or security requirement. Instead, policies, standards, and procedures should exist only to support business objectives or mission requirements; they are elements that aid in the execution of management policies. The book emphasizes how information security must be integrated into all aspects of the business process. It examines the 12 enterprise-wide (Tier 1) policies, and maps information security requirements to each. The text also discusses the need for top-specific (Tier 2) policies and application-specific (Tier 3) policies and details how they map with standards and procedures. It may be tempting to download some organization’s policies from the Internet, but Peltier cautions against that approach. Instead, he investigates how best to use examples of policies, standards, and procedures toward the achievement of goals. He analyzes the influx of national and international standards, and outlines how to effectively use them to meet the needs of your business.","publisher":"CRC Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TDg2tHV6BNMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":408,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TDg2tHV6BNMC&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TDg2tHV6BNMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=138&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781783982028","title":"Mastering Data Analysis with R","author":"Gergely Daroczi","publish_date":"2015-09-30","description":"Gain sharp insights into your data and solve real-world data science problems with R—from data munging to modeling and visualizationAbout This Book• Handle your data with precision and care for optimal business intelligence• Restructure and transform your data to inform decision-making• Packed with practical advice and tips to help you get to grips with data miningWho This Book Is ForIf you are a data scientist or R developer who wants to explore and optimize your use of R's advanced features and tools, this is the book for you.

The book covers OIDs, MIBs, community strings, traps, and other technical elements. But the main focus is on practical network administration: how to configure SNMP agents and network management stations, how to use SNMP to retrieve and modify variables on network devices, how to configure management software to react to traps sent by managed devices. Essential SNMPexplores both commercial and open source packages, including HP's OpenView, Castle Rock's SNMPc, the Net-SNMP tools, Simon Leinen's Perl SNMP support, and MRTG. Administrators will come away with ideas for writing scripts to help them manage their networks, create managed objects, and extend the operation of SNMP agents.

It covers many basic and advanced techniques for the identification of anomalous or frequently recurring patterns in a graph, the discovery of groups or clusters of nodes that share common patterns of attributes and relationships, the extraction of patterns that distinguish one category of graphs from another, and the use of those patterns to predict the category of new graphs. Hands-On Application of Graph Data Mining Each chapter in the book focuses on a graph mining task, such as link analysis, cluster analysis, and classification. Through applications using real data sets, the book demonstrates how computational techniques can help solve real-world problems. The applications covered include network intrusion detection, tumor cell diagnostics, face recognition, predictive toxicology, mining metabolic and protein-protein interaction networks, and community detection in social networks. Develops Intuition through Easy-to-Follow Examples and Rigorous Mathematical Foundations Every algorithm and example is accompanied with R code. This allows readers to see how the algorithmic techniques correspond to the process of graph data analysis and to use the graph mining techniques in practice.

Maloney","publish_date":"2012-09-02","description":"Many of the commonly used methods for modeling and fitting psychophysical data are special cases of statistical procedures of great power and generality, notably the Generalized Linear Model (GLM). This book illustrates how to fit data from a variety of psychophysical paradigms using modern statistical methods and the statistical language R. The paradigms include signal detection theory, psychometric function fitting, classification images and more. In two chapters, recently developed methods for scaling appearance, maximum likelihood difference scaling and maximum likelihood conjoint measurement are examined. The authors also consider the application of mixed-effects models to psychophysical data. R is an open-source programming language that is widely used by statisticians and is seeing enormous growth in its application to data in all fields. It is interactive, containing many powerful facilities for optimization, model evaluation, model selection, and graphical display of data. The reader who fits data in R can readily make use of these methods. The researcher who uses R to fit and model his data has access to most recently developed statistical methods. This book does not assume that the reader is familiar with R, and a little experience with any programming language is all that is needed to appreciate this book. There are large numbers of examples of R in the text and the source code for all examples is available in an R package MPDiR available through R. Kenneth Knoblauch is a researcher in the Department of Integrative Neurosciences in Inserm Unit 846, The Stem Cell and Brain Research Institute and associated with the University Claude Bernard, Lyon 1, in France. Laurence T. Maloney is Professor of Psychology and Neural Science at New York University. His research focusses on applications of mathematical models to perception, motor control and decision making.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AGMEsjX8LSMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":365,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AGMEsjX8LSMC&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AGMEsjX8LSMC&pg=PA302&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=156&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781783989515","title":"R Data Visualization Cookbook","author":"Atmajitsinh Gohil","publish_date":"2015-01-29","description":"If you are a data journalist, academician, student or freelance designer who wants to learn about data visualization, this book is for you.

Correlation-based methods of scientific enquiry, however, use linear algebra and are unsuited to analyzing set relations. The development of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) by Charles Ragin has given social scientists a formal tool for identifying set-theoretic connections based on Boolean algebra. As a result, interest in this method has markedly risen among social scientists in recent years. This book offers the first complete introduction on how to perform QCA in the R software environment for statistical computing and graphics with the QCA package. Developed as a comprehensive solution, QCA provides an unprecedented scope of functionality for analyzing crisp, multi-value and fuzzy sets. The reader is not required to have knowledge of R, but the book assumes an understanding of the fundamentals of QCA. Using examples from published work, the authors demonstrate how to make the most of QCA’s wide-ranging capabilities for the reader’s own purposes. Although mainly written for political scientists, this book is also of interest to scholars from other disciplines in the social sciences such as sociology, business, management, organization, anthropology, education and health.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-Y_Mzk00CioC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":99,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-Y_Mzk00CioC&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-Y_Mzk00CioC&pg=PA5&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=162&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9783319025322","title":"Introduction to Data Analysis and Graphical Presentation in Biostatistics with R: Statistics in the Large","author":"Thomas W.

Alexander Beaujean","publish_date":"2014-05-09","description":"This step-by-step guide is written for R and latent variable model (LVM) novices. Utilizing a path model approach and focusing on the lavaan package, this book is designed to help readers quickly understand LVMs and their analysis in R. The author reviews the reasoning behind the syntax selected and provides examples that demonstrate how to analyze data for a variety of LVMs. Featuring examples applicable to psychology, education, business, and other social and health sciences, minimal text is devoted to theoretical underpinnings. The material is presented without the use of matrix algebra. As a whole the book prepares readers to write about and interpret LVM results they obtain in R. Each chapter features background information, boldfaced key terms defined in the glossary, detailed interpretations of R output, descriptions of how to write the analysis of results for publication, a summary, R based practice exercises (with solutions included in the back of the book), and references and related readings. Margin notes help readers better understand LVMs and write their own R syntax. Examples using data from published work across a variety of disciplines demonstrate how to use R syntax for analyzing and interpreting results. R functions, syntax, and the corresponding results appear in gray boxes to help readers quickly locate this material. A unique index helps readers quickly locate R functions, packages, and datasets. The book and accompanying website at http://blogs.baylor.edu/rlatentvariable/ provides all of the data for the book’s examples and exercises as well as R syntax so readers can replicate the analyses. The book reviews how to enter the data into R, specify the LVMs, and obtain and interpret the estimated parameter values. The book opens with the fundamentals of using R including how to download the program, use functions, and enter and manipulate data. Chapters 2 and 3 introduce and then extend path models to include latent variables. Chapter 4 shows readers how to analyze a latent variable model with data from more than one group, while Chapter 5 shows how to analyze a latent variable model with data from more than one time period. Chapter 6 demonstrates the analysis of dichotomous variables, while Chapter 7 demonstrates how to analyze LVMs with missing data. Chapter 8 focuses on sample size determination using Monte Carlo methods, which can be used with a wide range of statistical models and account for missing data. The final chapter examines hierarchical LVMs, demonstrating both higher-order and bi-factor approaches. The book concludes with three Appendices: a review of common measures of model fit including their formulae and interpretation; syntax for other R latent variable models packages; and solutions for each chapter’s exercises. Intended as a supplementary text for graduate and/or advanced undergraduate courses on latent variable modeling, factor analysis, structural equation modeling, item response theory, measurement, or multivariate statistics taught in psychology, education, human development, business, economics, and social and health sciences, this book also appeals to researchers in these fields.

With Rcpp, the transfer of data between R and C++ is nearly seamless, and high-performance statistical computing is finally accessible to most R users. Rcpp should be part of every statistician's toolbox. -- Michael Braun, MIT Sloan School of Management \"Seamless R and C++ integration with Rcpp\" is simply a wonderful book. For anyone who uses C/C++ and R, it is an indispensable resource. The writing is outstanding. A huge bonus is the section on applications. This section covers the matrix packages Armadillo and Eigen and the GNU Scientific Library as well as RInside which enables you to use R inside C++. These applications are what most of us need to know to really do scientific programming with R and C++. I love this book. -- Robert McCulloch, University of Chicago Booth School of Business Rcpp is now considered an essential package for anybody doing serious computational research using R. Dirk's book is an excellent companion and takes the reader from a gentle introduction to more advanced applications via numerous examples and efficiency enhancing gems. The book is packed with all you might have ever wanted to know about Rcpp, its cousins (RcppArmadillo, RcppEigen .etc.), modules, package development and sugar. Overall, this book is a must-have on your shelf. -- Sanjog Misra, UCLA Anderson School of Management The Rcpp package represents a major leap forward for scientific computations with R. With very few lines of C++ code, one has R's data structures readily at hand for further computations in C++. Hence, high-level numerical programming can be made in C++ almost as easily as in R, but often with a substantial speed gain. Dirk is a crucial person in these developments, and his book takes the reader from the first fragile steps on to using the full Rcpp machinery. A very recommended book! -- Søren Højsgaard, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Aalborg University, Denmark \"Seamless R and C ++ Integration with Rcpp\" provides the first comprehensive introduction to Rcpp. Rcpp has become the most widely-used language extension for R, and is deployed by over one-hundred different CRAN and BioConductor packages. Rcpp permits users to pass scalars, vectors, matrices, list or entire R objects back and forth between R and C++ with ease. This brings the depth of the R analysis framework together with the power, speed, and efficiency of C++. Dirk Eddelbuettel has been a contributor to CRAN for over a decade and maintains around twenty packages. He is the Debian/Ubuntu maintainer for R and other quantitative software, edits the CRAN Task Views for Finance and High-Performance Computing, is a co-founder of the annual R/Finance conference, and an editor of the Journal of Statistical Software.

It contains concise explanations of essential MATLAB commands, as well as easily understood instructions for using MATLAB's programming features, graphical capabilities, simulation models, and rich desktop interface. Written for MATLAB 7, it can also be used with earlier (and later) versions of MATLAB. This book teaches how to graph functions, solve equations, manipulate images, and much more. It contains explicit instructions for using MATLAB's companion software, Simulink, which allows graphical models to be built for dynamical systems. MATLAB's new \"publish\" feature is discussed, which allows mathematical computations to be combined with text and graphics, to produce polished, integrated, interactive documents. For the beginner it explains everything needed to start using MATLAB, while experienced users making the switch to MATLAB 7 from an earlier version will also find much useful information here.","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NekrOjT8oSIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":null,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NekrOjT8oSIC&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":6,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NekrOjT8oSIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=186&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"New technology and R & D information: an international comparison of trends : report to British Library (R & D) Department","author":"Arthur Jack Meadows, Alan Singleton, M. van der Lem, Primary Communications Research Centre","publish_date":"1983-04","description":null,"publisher":null,"image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qwQsAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":33,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qwQsAQAAIAAJ&q=r,+subject:computers&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=187&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780895883544","title":"Power User's Guide to R:BASE","author":"Alan Simpson, Cheryl Currid, Craig A.

The editors have gathered an expert team of engineers, social scientists, and cultural theorists for the first extensive treatment of human communication in this exciting medium. The first part introduces the reader to VR's state-of-the-art as well as future trends. In the next section, leading research scientists discuss how knowledge of communication can be used to build more effective and exciting communication applications of virtual reality. Looking ahead, the authors explore pioneering approaches to VR narratives, interpersonal communication, the use of 3D sound, and the building of VR entertainment complexes. In the final section, the authors zoom out to view the big picture -- the psychological, social, and cultural implications of virtual reality. Thought-provoking discussions consider important communication issues such as: * How will virtual reality influence perception of reality? * What are the legal issues defining communication in virtual reality? * What kind of cultural trends will this technology encourage?","publisher":"Lawrence Erlbaum Associates","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XmoWjyZd6pMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":401,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XmoWjyZd6pMC&dq=r,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=192&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780201924695","title":"SAP R/3 Administration","author":"Liane Will","publish_date":"1998-01","description":"'Software from SAP has become the industry standard: 90% of the top 500 companies in Europe work with it.'
