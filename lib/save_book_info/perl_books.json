[{"isbn":"9780596555023","title":"Perl Best Practices","author":"Damian Conway","publish_date":"2005-07-12","description":"Many programmers code by instinct, relying on convenient habits or a \"style\" they picked up early on. They aren't conscious of all the choices they make, like how they format their source, the names they use for variables, or the kinds of loops they use. They're focused entirely on problems they're solving, solutions they're creating, and algorithms they're implementing. So they write code in the way that seems natural, that happens intuitively, and that feels good. But if you're serious about your profession, intuition isn't enough. Perl Best Practices author Damian Conway explains that rules, conventions, standards, and practices not only help programmers communicate and coordinate with one another, they also provide a reliable framework for thinking about problems, and a common language for expressing solutions. This is especially critical in Perl, because the language is designed to offer many ways to accomplish the same task, and consequently it supports many incompatible dialects. With a good dose of Aussie humor, Dr. Conway (familiar to many in the Perl community) offers 256 guidelines on the art of coding to help you write better Perl code--in fact, the best Perl code you possibly can. The guidelines cover code layout, naming conventions, choice of data and control structures, program decomposition, interface design and implementation, modularity, object orientation, error handling, testing, and debugging. They're designed to work together to produce code that is clear, robust, efficient, maintainable, and concise, but Dr. Conway doesn't pretend that this is the one true universal and unequivocal set of best practices. Instead, Perl Best Practices offers coherent and widely applicable suggestions based on real-world experience of how code is actually written, rather than on someone's ivory-tower theories on howsoftware ought to be created. Most of all, Perl Best Practices offers guidelines that actually work, and that many developers around the world are already using. Much like Perl itself, these guidelines are about helping you to get your job done, without getting in the way. Praise for Perl Best Practices from Perl community members: \"As a manager of a large Perl project, I'd ensure that every member of my team has a copy of Perl Best Practices on their desk, and use it as the basis for an in-house style guide.\"-- Randal Schwartz \"There are no more excuses for writing bad Perl programs. All levels of Perl programmer will be more productive after reading this book.\"-- Peter Scott \"Perl Best Practices will be the next big important book in the evolution of Perl. The ideas and practices Damian lays down will help bring Perl out from under the embarrassing heading of \"scripting languages\". Many of us have known Perl is a real programming language, worthy of all the tasks normally delegated to Java and C++. With Perl Best Practices, Damian shows specifically how and why, so everyone else can see, too.\"-- Andy Lester \"Damian's done what many thought impossible: show how to build large, maintainable Perl applications, while still letting Perl be the powerful, expressive language that programmers have loved for years.\"-- Bill Odom \"Finally, a means to bring lasting order to the process and product of real Perl development teams.\"-- Andrew Sundstrom \"Perl Best Practices provides a valuable education in how to write robust, maintainable Perl, and is a definitive citation source when coaching other programmers.\"-- Bennett Todd\"I've been teaching Perl for years, and find the same question keeps being asked: Where can I find a reference for writing reusable, maintainable Perl code? Finally I have a decent answer.\"-- Paul Fenwick\"At last a well researched, well thought-out, comprehensive guide to Perl style. Instead of each of us developing our own, we can learn good practices from one of Perl's most prolific and experienced authors. I recommend this book to anyone who prefers getting on with the job rather than going back and fixing errors caused by syntax and poor style issues.\"-- Jacinta Richardson\"If you care about programming in any language read this book. Even if you don't intend to follow all of the practices, thinking through your style will improve it.\"-- Steven Lembark\"The Perl community's best author is back with another outstanding book. There has never been a comprehensive reference on high quality Perl coding and style until Perl Best Practices.

Within a remarkable short time, TPJ acquired a cult-following and became the voice of the Perl community. Every serious Perl programmer subscribed to it, and every notable Perl guru jumped at the opportunity to write for it. Back issues were swapped like trading cards. No longer in print format, TPJ remains the quintessential spirit of Perl--a publication for and by Perl programmers who see fun and beauty in an admittedly quirky little language.Games, Diversions, and Perl Culture is the third volume of The Best of the Perl Journal, compiled and re-edited by the original editor and publisher of The Perl Journal, Jon Orwant. In this series, we've taken the very best (and still relevant) articles published in TPJ over its 5 years of publication and immortalized them into three volumes.The 47 articles included in this volume are simply some of the best Perl articles ever written on the subjects of games, diversions, and the unique culture of this close-knit community, by some of the best Perl authors and coders. Games, Diversions & Perl Culture focuses on entertaining topics that make Perl users such fanatics about the language. You'll find all of the playful features TPJ offered over the years, including the Obfuscated Perl Contests, Perl Quiz Shows, humor articles, and renowned one-line recipes. The book also contains a panoply of quirky applications of Perl, including genetic algorithms, home automation, music programming, and an entire section on natural language processing.This anthology is an unmatched compendium of Perl lore.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1GkMNv7PM68C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":588,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1GkMNv7PM68C&dq=perl,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1GkMNv7PM68C&printsec=frontcover&dq=perl,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781565926097","title":"Perl for System Administration","author":"David N.

But if you're a biologist with little or no programming experience, starting out in Perl can be a challenge. Many biologists have a difficult time learning how to apply the language to bioinformatics. The most popular Perl programming books are often too theoretical and too focused on computer science for a non-programming biologist who needs to solve very specific problems.Beginning Perl for Bioinformatics is designed to get you quickly over the Perl language barrier by approaching programming as an important new laboratory skill, revealing Perl programs and techniques that are immediately useful in the lab. Each chapter focuses on solving a particular bioinformatics problem or class of problems, starting with the simplest and increasing in complexity as the book progresses. Each chapter includes programming exercises and teaches bioinformatics by showing and modifying programs that deal with various kinds of practical biological problems. By the end of the book you'll have a solid understanding of Perl basics, a collection of programs for such tasks as parsing BLAST and GenBank, and the skills to take on more advanced bioinformatics programming. Some of the later chapters focus in greater detail on specific bioinformatics topics. This book is suitable for use as a classroom textbook, for self-study, and as a reference.The book covers: Programming basics and working with DNA sequences and strings Debugging your code Simulating gene mutations using random number generators Regular expressions and finding motifs in data Arrays, hashes, and relational databases Regular expressions and restriction maps Using Perl to parse PDB records, annotations in GenBank, and BLAST output","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OG2xVZnf_ckC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":386,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OG2xVZnf_ckC&dq=perl,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":3.0,"ratings_count":5,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OG2xVZnf_ckC&printsec=frontcover&dq=perl,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781593270629","title":"Wicked Cool Perl Scripts: Useful Perl Scripts that Solve Difficult Problems","author":"Steve Oualline","publish_date":"2006","description":"Provides information on creating a variety of Perl utilities.","publisher":"No Starch Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ItaXCnhSmBgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":312,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ItaXCnhSmBgC&dq=perl,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":3.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ItaXCnhSmBgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=perl,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780735712287","title":"Perl for C Programmers","author":"Steve Oualline","publish_date":"2002","description":"Perl is a commonly used language in web development because of its powerful ability for text manipulation.

The initial part of the book discusses Perl expressions, statements, control flow, built-in data types such as arrays and hashes, and complex data structures built using references. On Perl has several chapters covering specialized topics. The chapter on socket-based network programming deals with forking and using fork to write complex interactive client-server programs. There is a chapter with in-depth discussion of CGI programming including error-handling and security issues that arise. The chapter on web-client programming deals with writing programs that access Web pages, fill up GET and POST forms, handle cookies and redirected Web pages. The book has several unique chapters not found in any other book on Perl in the market. The chapter on security discusses hashes such as MD5, message authentication codes (MACs), digital signature schemes, and encryption techniques such as DES, Rijndael, and RSA. Other chapters deal with writing recursive programs that work with files and directories; this chapter also discusses predefined modules that deal with portability in file names and paths across operating systems, recursive traversal of file hierarchies and tarring and untarring of filles. The chapter on functional programming illustrates that Perl functions are first-class, can be used to write closures and can be composed to form more complex functions. In particular, this can be useful for programming in artificial intelligence.","publisher":"Universal-Publishers","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aMuuTttVDcIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":660,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aMuuTttVDcIC&dq=perl,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aMuuTttVDcIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=perl,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=21&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781118085189","title":"Perl For Dummies","author":"Paul Hoffman","publish_date":"2011-05-09","description":null,"publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KOUoU_MTg8MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":408,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KOUoU_MTg8MC&dq=perl,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KOUoU_MTg8MC&printsec=frontcover&dq=perl,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=22&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781578702152","title":"Win32 Perl Scripting: The Administrator's Handbook","author":"Dave Roth","publish_date":"2000","description":"Scripting has become an enormously popular method of managing and maintaining Windows NT and 2000 networks—as evidenced by the success of Windows NT Shell Scripting, which has sold over 30,000 copies in 2 years.

Perl is yet another powerful element of the scripting arsenal, yet since it has been ported to the Windows environment, very little information has been published on how to employ this extremely effective tool. Win32 Perl is so powerful that it can accomplish virtually any task that you may want to perform. Dave Roth, prolific creator of Win32 extensions, is prepared to share his unique insight into how these tasks can be accomplished and provide scripts that can be immediately employed.

Like other templating systems, the Template Toolkit allows programmers to embed Perl code and custom macros into HTML documents in order to create customized documents on the fly. But unlike the others, the Template Toolkit is as facile at producing HTML as it is at producing XML, PDF, or any other output format. And because it has its own simple templating language, templates can be written and edited by people who don't know Perl. In short, the Template Toolkit combines the best features of its competitors, with ease-of-use and flexibility, resulting in a technology that's fast, powerful and extensible, and ideally suited to the production and maintenance of web content and other dynamic document systems. In Perl Template Toolkit you'll find detailed coverage of this increasingly popular technology. Written by core members of the technology's development team, the book guides you through the entire process of installing, configuring, using, and extending the Template Toolkit. It begins with a fast-paced but thorough tutorial on building web content with the Template Toolkit, and then walks you through generating and using data files, particularly with XML. It also provides detailed information on the Template Toolkit's modules, libraries, and tools in addition to a complete reference manual. Topics in the book include: Getting started with the template toolkit The Template language Template directives Filters Plugins Extending the Template Toolkit Accessing databases XML Advanced static web page techniques Dynamic web content and web applications The only book to cover this important tool, Perl Template Toolkit is essential reading for any Perl programmer who wants to create dynamic web content that is remarkably easy to maintain.

You need tools that enable performance analysis of application workflow across the entire enterprise. That's what PDQ (Pretty Damn Quick) provides. PDQ is an open-source performance analyzer based on the paradigm of queues. Queues are ubiquitous in every computing environment as buffers, and since any application architecture can be represented as a circuit of queueing delays, PDQ is a natural fit for analyzing system performance. Building on the success of the first edition, this considerably expanded second edition now comprises four parts. Part I contains the foundational concepts, as well as a new first chapter that explains the central role of queues in successful performance analysis. Part II provides the basics of queueing theory in a highly intelligible style for the non-mathematician; little more than high-school algebra being required. Part III presents many practical examples of how PDQ can be applied. The PDQ manual has been relegated to an appendix in Part IV, along with solutions to the exercises contained in each chapter.

However, Perl incorporates many features that have their roots in other languages such as Lisp. These advanced features are not well understood and are rarely used by most Perl programmers, but they are very powerful. They can automate tasks in everyday programming that are difficult to solve in any other way. One of the most powerful of these techniques is writing functions that manufacture or modify other functions. For example, instead of writing ten similar functions, a programmer can write a general pattern or framework that can then create the functions as needed according to the pattern. For several years Mark Jason Dominus has worked to apply functional programming techniques to Perl. Now Mark brings these flexible programming methods that he has successfully taught in numerous tutorials and training sessions to a wider audience. * Introduces powerful programming methods new to most Perl programmers that were previously the domain of computer scientists * Gradually builds up confidence by describing techniques of progressive sophistication * Shows how to improve everyday programs and includes numerous engaging code examples to illustrate the methods","publisher":"Morgan Kaufmann","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4_q8JJWNaTsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":600,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4_q8JJWNaTsC&dq=perl,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":2,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4_q8JJWNaTsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=perl,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=41&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781430200147","title":"Pro Perl","author":"Peter Wainwright","publish_date":"2006-11-01","description":"*Condensed, readable style; delivers tremendous value in just one book.

Every serious Perl programmer subscribed to it, and every notable Perl guru jumped at the opportunity to write for it. TPJ explained critical topics such as regular expressions, databases, and object-oriented programming, and demonstrated Perl's utility for fields as diverse as astronomy, biology, economics, AI, and games. The magazine gave birth to both the Obfuscated Perl Contest and the Perl Poetry contest, and remains a proud and timeless achievement of Perl during one of its most exciting periods of development.Computer Science and Perl Programming is the first volume of The Best of the Perl Journal, compiled and re-edited by the original editor and publisher of The Perl Journal, Jon Orwant. In this series, we've taken the very best (and still relevant) articles published in TPJ over its 5 years of publication and immortalized them into three volumes. This volume has 70 articles devoted to hard-core computer science, advanced programming techniques, and the underlying mechanics of Perl.Here's a sample of what you'll find inside: Jeffrey Friedl on Understanding Regexes Mark Jason Dominus on optimizing your Perl programs with Memoization Damian Conway on Parsing Tim Meadowcroft on integrating Perl with Microsoft Office Larry Wall on the culture of Perl Written by 41 of the most prominent and prolific members of the closely-knit Perl community, this anthology does what no other book can, giving unique insight into the real-life applications and powerful techniques made possible by Perl.Other books tell you how to use Perl, but this book goes far beyond that: it shows you not only how to use Perl, but what you could use Perl for.

While other languages have stagnated, Perl remains fresh, thanks to its community-based development model, which encourages the sharing of information among users. This tradition of knowledge-sharing allows developers to find answers to almost any Perl question they can dream up. And you can find many of those answers right here in Perl Hacks. Like all books in O'Reilly's Hacks Series, Perl Hacks appeals to a variety of programmers, whether you're an experienced developer or a dabbler who simply enjoys exploring technology. Each hack is a short lesson--some are practical exercises that teach you essential skills, while others merely illustrate some of the fun things that Perl can do. Most hacks have two parts: a direct answer to the immediate problem you need to solve right now and a deeper, subtler technique that you can adapt to other situations. Learn how to add CPAN shortcuts to the Firefox web browser, read files backwards, write graphical games in Perl, and much more. For your convenience, Perl Hacks is divided by topic--not according toany sense of relative difficulty--so you can skip around and stop at any hack you like.

LWP is a suite of modules for fetching and processing web pages.The Web is a vast data source that contains everything from stock prices to movie credits, and with LWP all that data is just a few lines of code away. Anything you do on the Web, whether it's buying or selling, reading or writing, uploading or downloading, news to e-commerce, can be controlled with Perl and LWP. You can automate Web-based purchase orders as easily as you can set up a program to download MP3 files from a web site.Perl & LWP covers: Understanding LWP and its design Fetching and analyzing URLs Extracting information from HTML using regular expressions and tokens Working with the structure of HTML documents using trees Setting and inspecting HTTP headers and response codes Managing cookies Accessing information that requires authentication Extracting links Cooperating with proxy caches Writing web spiders (also known as robots) in a safe fashion Perl & LWP includes many step-by-step examples that show how to apply the various techniques. Programs to extract information from the web sites of BBC News, Altavista, ABEBooks.com, and the Weather Underground, to name just a few, are explained in detail, so that you understand how and why they work.Perl programmers who want to automate and mine the web can pick up this book and be immediately productive.

More and more companies are using Perl as their language of choice for projects great and small in large part because of Perl's popularity among web CGI programmers. Perl's ability to quickly generate and manipulate text files, along with its flexibility in communicating with a variety of systems and platforms, make it indispensable. In many organizations, however, especially those with large-scale programming teams, Perl adopters still fight a daily battle for acceptance. Perl is perceived by the IT managers in these organizations as difficult to manage (because there's no one way to program), impossible to maintain (because deployment does not require compilation), prone to error (because its variables are weakly typed), and maybe even dangerous (because hackers use it). Applied Perl tackles these misperceptions through exploring cases where Perl is being applied inventively in the film industry, financial community, Internet community and scientific community. The book teaches new techniques to advanced Perl programmers and provides sample code and applications that can be customized. In addition it is an advocacy book that shows the power of the Perl language in tangible terms.","publisher":"Wiley","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=061QAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":405,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=061QAAAAMAAJ&q=perl,+subject:computers&dq=perl,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=66&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780596555634","title":"Automating System Administration with Perl: Tools to Make You More Efficient","author":"David N.

Maintain, optimize, and scale any Perl software... whether you wrote it or not Perl software engineering best practices for enterprise environments Includes case studies and code in a fun-to-read format Today's Perl developers spend 60-80% of their time working with existing Perl code. Now, there's a start-to-finish guide to understanding that code, maintaining it, updating it, and refactoring it for maximum performance and reliability. Peter J. Scott, lead author of Perl Debugged, has written the first systematic guide to Perl software engineering. Through extensive examples, he shows how to bring powerful discipline, consistency, and structure to any Perl program-new or old. You'll discover how to: Scale existing Perl code to serve larger network, Web, enterprise, or e-commerce applications Rewrite, restructure, and upgrade any Perl program for improved performance Bring standards and best practices to your entire library of Perl software Organize Perl code into modules and components that are easier to reuse Upgrade code written for earlier versions of Perl Write and execute better tests for your software...or anyone else's Use Perl in team-based, methodology-driven environments Document your Perl code more effectively and efficiently If you've ever inherited Perl code that's hard to maintain, if you write Perl code others will read, if you want to write code that'll be easier for you to maintain, the book that comes to your rescue is Perl Medic. If you code in Perl, you need to read this book.–Adam Turoff, Technical Editor, The Perl Review. Perl Medic is more than a book. It is a well-crafted strategy for approaching, updating, and furthering the cause of inherited Perl programs.–Allen Wyke, co-author of several computer books including JavaScript Unleashed and Pure JavaScript. Scott's explanations of complex material are smooth and deceptively simple. He knows his subject matter and his craft-he makes it look easy. Scott remains relentless practical-even the 'Analysis' chapter is filled with code and tests to run.–Dan Livingston, author of several computer books including Advanced Flash 5: Actionscript in Action","publisher":"Addison-Wesley","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3V1_AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":334,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3V1_AAAAQBAJ&dq=perl,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3V1_AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA309&dq=perl,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=83&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780201734881","title":"Perl to Python Migration","author":"Martin C.

One was that I’ve now written a couple of books that have to do with incident response and forensic analysis on Windows systems, and I used a lot of Perl in both books. Okay...I’ll come clean...I used nothing but Perl in both books! What I’ve seen as a result of this is that many readers want to use the tools, but don’t know how...they simply aren’t familiar with Perl, with interpreted (or scripting) languages in general, and may not be entirely comfortable with running tools at the command line. This book is intended for anyone who has an interest in useful Perl scripting, in particular on the Windows platform, for the purpose of incident response, and forensic analysis, and application monitoring. While a thorough grounding in scripting languages (or in Perl specifically) is not required, it helpful in fully and more completely understanding the material and code presented in this book. This book contains information that is useful to consultants who perform incident response and computer forensics, specifically as those activities pertain to MS Windows systems (Windows 2000, XP, 2003, and some Vista). My hope is that not only will consultants (such as myself) find this material valuable, but so will system administrators, law enforcement officers, and students in undergraduate and graduate programs focusing on computer forensics. Code can be found at: http://www.elsevierdirect.com/companion.jsp?ISBN=9781597491730 *Perl Scripting for Live Response Using Perl, there’s a great deal of information you can retrieve from systems, locally or remotely, as part of troubleshooting or investigating an issue. Perl scripts can be run from a central management point, reaching out to remote systems in order to collect information, or they can be \"compiled\" into standalone executables using PAR, PerlApp, or Perl2Exe so that they can be run on systems that do not have ActiveState’s Perl distribution (or any other Perl distribution) installed. *Perl Scripting for Computer Forensic Analysis Perl is an extremely useful and powerful tool for performing computer forensic analysis. While there are applications available that let an examiner access acquired images and perform some modicum of visualization, there are relatively few tools that meet the specific needs of a specific examiner working on a specific case. This is where the use of Perl really shines through and becomes apparent. *Perl Scripting for Application Monitoring Working with enterprise-level Windows applications requires a great deal of analysis and constant monitoring. Automating the monitoring portion of this effort can save a great deal of time, reduce system downtimes, and improve the reliability of your overall application. By utilizing Perl scripts and integrating them with the application technology, you can easily build a simple monitoring framework that can alert you to current or future application issues.","publisher":"Syngress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_lgsIjvcDUQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":232,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_lgsIjvcDUQC&dq=perl,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_lgsIjvcDUQC&pg=PR23&dq=perl,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=111&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781590590188","title":"Writing Perl Modules for CPAN","author":"Sam Tregar","publish_date":"2002-08-14","description":"Writing Perl Modules for CPAN offers Perl developers a comprehensive guide to using and contributing to the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN). Starting with a general overview of CPAN's history, network topology, and navigational mechanisms, the book quickly brings you up-to-speed regarding how to search out and install available modules. However, in the true open source spirit, author and experienced Perl developer Sam Tregar teaches you how to not only use, but also contribute to CPAN via an in-depth discussion of module creation, submission, and maintenance. Beginning with a survey of basic design principles, Tregar takes care to discuss all issues relevant to developers wishing to create great Perl modules, including choosing a proper name, properly using Perl's POD (plain old documentation) feature, concepts surrounding functional and object-oriented API development, and much more. Tregar then proceeds with a complete dissertation of how modules should conform to CPAN module specifications, covering required distribution files and coding considerations, in addition to offering advice regarding proper module testing. After demonstrating how to create a module and prepare it for release, Tregar guides you through the CPAN module submission process and discusses module maintenance once the module has been contributed to the CPAN service.

Inside the interactive debugger environment, you're prompted for commands that let you examine your source code, set breakpoints, dump out function call stacks, change values of variables, and much more. It's so convenient that some programmers run it just to test out Perl constructs as they create a program. But although it's on their radar, not many Perl programmers take the time to master the debugger. That's where the Perl Debugger Pocket Reference comes in. This little book provides a quick and convenient path to mastery of the Perl debugger and its commands. Written by a core member of the Perl debugger development team, it's an ideal quick reference to debugger commands, as well as a detailed tutorial on how to get started. The Perl Debugger Pocket Reference provides complete coverage in a conveniently small package. Maybe you write code so clean you never have to look at it twice. Or perhaps you'd rather focus your energies on writing clean code, rather than learning about the debugger. But if you need to learn about the Perl debugger in a hurry, the Perl Debugger Pocket Reference is the book you'll want to have close by. And you can always keep a copy on hand to share with programmers who need it more than you do. O'Reilly's Pocket References have become a favorite among programmers everywhere. By providing a wealth of important details in a concise, well-organized format, these handy books deliver just what you need to complete the task at hand. When you've reached a sticking point in your work and need to get to a solution quickly, the new Perl Debugger Pocket Reference will get you back on the right track.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N_QqOniRHXQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":135,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N_QqOniRHXQC&pg=PR3&dq=perl,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=114&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781449390907","title":"Mastering Perl for Bioinformatics","author":"James Tisdall","publish_date":"2003-09-25","description":"Historically, programming hasn't been considered a critical skill for biologists. But now, with access to vast amounts of biological data contained in public databases, programming skills are increasingly in strong demand in biology research and development.

But graphical browsers can be limiting: the very interactivity that makes them so intuitive to use also makes them clumsy for automating tasks. If you want to get the latest weather report every few hours, track a Federal Express package online, or use a dictionary server repeatedly throughout the day, using your browser to perform the same task over and over can become cumbersome. As with any repetitive task, these applications are best done by writing a script. Web Client Programming with Perlshows you how to extend scripting skills to the Web. This book teaches you the basics of how browsers communicate with servers and how to write your own customized Web clients to automate common tasks. It is intended for those who are motivated to develop software that offers a more flexible and dynamic response than a standard Web browser. Using this book, you'll learn how to: Automate repetitive queries on the Web Detect broken hyperlinks on your site Write simple \"robots\" that traverse hyperlinks across a site, and across the Web in general This book will be of interest to: Web administrators who need to automate repetitive tasks or reduce maintenance time UNIX shell programmers who want to interface their scripts to the Web Commercial software developers and consultants who need reference material for technical Web specifications and proof-of-concept examples Most of the examples in this book use Perl, a versatile and portable language that is already familiar to many CGI programmers and UNIX power users. The book does not teach Perl, but the techniques used in the book should be easily followed by anyone with some programming background and can be adapted to whatever language you choose.","publisher":"Oreilly & Associates Incorporated","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u8DBnWT68p4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":213,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":3.5,"ratings_count":2,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u8DBnWT68p4C&dq=perl,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=137&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780619034405","title":"CGI/Perl","author":"Diane Zak","publish_date":"2001-08-01","description":"CGI/Perl teaches users how to write CGI programs using the Perl programming language, the most common way Web sites accept orders over the Internet.

It does so by introducing the fundamentals of XML, Document Type De?nitions (DTDs), XML Namespaces, XML Schema, and XML parsing, and illustrating these concepts with speci?c bioinformatics case studies. The book does not assume any previous knowledge of XML and is geared toward those who want a solid introduction to fundamental XML concepts. The book is divided into nine chapters: Chapter 1: Introduction to XML for Bioinformatics. This chapter provides an introduction to XML and describes the use of XML in biological data exchange. A bird’s-eye view of our ?rst case study, the Distributed Annotation System (DAS), is provided and we examine a sample DAS XML document. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the pros and cons of using XML in bioinformatic applications. Chapter 2: Fundamentals of XML and BSML. This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of XML and the Bioinformatic Sequence Markup Language (BSML). We explore the origins of XML, de?ne basic rules for XML document structure, and introduce XML Na- spaces.

Because all the patterns work harmoniously together and have clearly documented relationships to each other, you’ll come away with a host of reusable solutions to common problems in business-software design. This book shows you how using a pattern or a fragment of a pattern can save you months of work and help you avoid costly errors. You’ll also discover how–when used in literate modeling–patterns can solve the difficult challenge of communicating UML models to broad audiences. The configurable patterns can be used manually to create executable code. However, the authors draw on their extensive experience to show you how to tap the significant power of MDA and UML for maximum automation.

Obviously yes: This is a book for people who already know how to program in another language, but don't know Perl. A book that gets through the basics as quickly as possible. How to do the fun stuff. A book that emphasizes good programming style in Perl. Many of the Perl programs are written in a quick-and-dirty style; I wanted to see if the style I have developed in other languages can translate. In many Perl books, object-oriented programming is treated as an optional feature for advanced programming. I wanted to bring it closer to the center of focus (although I am anything but an object-oriented bigot). In presenting Perl features, I tried to find examples that are interesting in their own right, and that encourage the reader to explore Perl's features. *** Published under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License.

Despite the diversity of activities and applications, the basic methodology and core tools needed to tackle bioinformatics problems is common to many projects. This unique book provides an invaluable introduction to three of the main tools used in the development of bioinformatics software - Perl, R and MySQL - and explains how these can be used together to tackle the complex data-driven challenges that typify modern biology. These industry standard open source tools form the core of many bioinformatics projects, both in academia and industry. The methodologies introduced are platform independent, and all the examples that feature have been tested on Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Building Bioinformatics Solutions is suitable for graduate students and researchers in the life sciences who wish to automate analyses or create their own databases and web-based tools. No prior knowledge of software development is assumed. Having worked through the book, the reader should have the necessary core skills to develop computational solutions for their specific research programmes.

This book concentrates on the practical coding required to build robust and capable web applications with Perl and MySQL. Starting from the fundamentals, we move from code snippets to fully functional Perl scripts that culminates in the project for the book – a feature rich data-driven bulletin board. Packed with code examples, this book leaves no stone unturned. The various practical methods the reader will require to build powerful web applications are covered in detail, using plain language descriptions and exercises. To cover the various implementations and configurations available with this program set, what we’ll do is work through a working example of a fairly complex bulletin board program that will utilize the full capabilities of Perl, the Apache web server, and the MySQL database. We’ll explore the various possibilities available for the creation of dynamic, data-driven web pages. The project is a working example of the technologies at play and a fully functional and feature rich data-driven bulletin board program. A bulletin board is a collection of topics that the users can post threads in. Within these threads are text, or text and image posts, that reflect the thread and topic categories.

Excerpt: Fortran (previously FORTRAN; both blends derived from IBM Mathematical Formula Translating System) is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative programming language that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing. Originally developed by IBM at their campus in south San Jose, California in the 1950s for scientific and engineering applications, Fortran came to dominate this area of programming early on and has been in continual use for over half a century in computationally intensive areas such as numerical weather prediction, finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, computational physics and computational chemistry. It is one of the most popular languages in the area of high-performance computing and is the language used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers. Fortran encompasses a lineage of versions, each of which evolved to add extensions to the language while usually retaining compatibility with previous versions. Successive versions have added support for processing of character-based data (FORTRAN 77), array programming, modular programming and object-based programming (Fortran 90 / 95), and object-oriented and generic programming (Fortran 2003).

Perl 6 is a programming language specification. It serves as a major revision to Perl, introducing elements of many modern and historical languages. Perl 6 is intended to have many implementations. Backward compatibility with earlier versions of Perl is not a direct goal, though a compatibility mode is part of the specification. The design process for Perl 6 began in 2000. Development on Pugs, the first implementation, began in 2005, and today there are multiple Perl 6 implementation projects. Rakudo Perl is based on Parrot and PGE, and releases a new version every month; as of February 2010[update], the project has released 26 stable versions. SMOP is written in C.

This book won't teach beginning Perl, database concepts, or server administration. Instead it puts an experienced programmer's bookshelf in context, showing how to develop a Web application project from start to finish. Because it is a Visual Blueprint, most tasks are explained using succinct step-by-step instructions on two-page modules—no flipping back and forth needed.

David Eisenberg","publish_date":"2002-02-05","description":"Scalable Vector Graphics -- or SVG -- is the new XML-based graphics standard from the W3C that will enable Web documents to be smaller, faster and more interactive. J. David Eisenberg's insightful book takes you through the ins and outs of SVG, beginning with basics needed to create simple line drawings and then moving through more complicated features like filters, transformations, and integration with Java, Perl, and XSLT.Unlike GIFs, JPEGs or PNGs (which are bitmapped), SVG images are both resolution- and device-independent, so that they can scale up or down to fit proportionally into any size display or any Internet device -- from PDAs to large office monitors and high-resolution printers. Smaller than bitmapped files and faster to download, SVG images can be rendered with different CSS styles for each environment. They work well across a range of available bandwidths.SVG makes it possible for designers to escape the constant need to update graphics by hand or use custom code to generate bitmap images. And while SVG was created with the Web in mind, the language has a variety of other uses. SVG greatly simplifies tasks like: Creating web sites whose graphics reflect the content of the page, changing automatically if the content changes Generating graphs and charts from information stored in a wide variety of sources Exchanging detailed drawings, from architectural plans to CAD layouts to project management diagrams Creating diagrams that users can explore by zooming in and panning around Generating bitmap images for use in older browsers using simple automatable templates Managing graphics that support multiple languages or translations Creating complex animation By focusing sharply on the markup at the foundation of SVG, SVG Essentials gives you a solid base on which to create your own custom tools. Explanations of key technical tools -- like XML, matrix math, and scripting -- are included as appendices, along with a reference to the SVG vocabulary.Whether you're a graphic designer in search of new tools or a programmer dealing with the complex task of creating and managing graphics, SVG Essentials provides you with the means to take advantage of SVG.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=shuDAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":360,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=shuDAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA218&dq=perl,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=216&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780993892905","title":"DocBook for Writers: ","author":"Peter Lavin","publish_date":"2015-02-02","description":"This book is an introduction to DocBook aimed at technical writers rather than developers.

Or have you ever wanted to publish information on the Web so that programs other than browsers could work with it? XML-RPC, a system for remote procedure calls built on XML and the ubiquitous HTTP protocol, is the solution you've been looking for.Programming Web Services with XML-RPC introduces the simple but powerful capabilities of XML-RPC, which lets you connect programs running on different computers with a minimum of fuss, by wrapping procedure calls in XML and establishing simple pathways for calling functions. With XML-RPC, Java programs can talk to Perl scripts, which can talk to Python programs, ASP applications, and so on. You can provide access to procedure calls without having to worry about the system on the other end, so it's easy to create services that are available on the Web.XML-RPC isn't the only solution for web services; the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is another much-hyped protocol for implementing web services. While XML-RPC provides fewer capabilities than SOAP, it also has far fewer interoperability problems and its capabilities and limitations are much better understood. XML-RPC is also stable, with over 30 implementations on a wide variety of platforms, so you can start doing real work with it immediately.Programming Web Services with XML-RPC covers the details of five XML-RPC implementations, so you can get started developing distributed applications in Java, Perl, Python, ASP, or PHP. The chapters on these implementations contain code examples that you can use as the basis for your own work. This book also provides in-depth coverage of the XML-RPC specification, which is helpful for low-level debugging of XML-RPC clients and servers. And if you want to build your own XML-RPC implementation for another environment, the detailed explanations in this book will serve as a foundation for that work.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CXvQAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":236,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CXvQAQAAQBAJ&dq=perl,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CXvQAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA161&dq=perl,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=221&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781590595817","title":"Blog Design Solutions","author":"Richard Rutter, Andy Budd, Simon Collison, Chris J Davis, Michael Heilemann, Phil Sherry, David Powers, John Oxton","publish_date":"2006-02-16","description":"Blogging has moved rapidly from being a craze to become a core feature of the Internet—from individuals sharing their thoughts with the world via online diaries, through fans talking about their favorite sports teams or music, right up to serious business minds discussing industry futures.

Teil: Server-Security Härten des Server-Systems, Einbrucherkennung mit Intrusion-Detection-Systemen, Desaster-Recovery, Notfallplan Dieses Buch bietet einen umfassenden Praxiseinstieg in die System- und Netzwerkadministration von Linux-Servern – am Beispiel von Debian GNU/Linux (Version 7, Wheezy). Ziel des Buches ist es, Ihnen die notwendigen Grundlagen zur Administration eines Linux-Servers in unterschiedlichen Umgebungen zu verschaffen. Dazu ist das Buch in fünf Teile gegliedert, die jeweils die verschiedenen Aspekte bzw. Anwendungsbereiche eines Servers beleuchten. Ein Schwerpunkt liegt auf den Hintergründen und Funktionsweisen der Systeme, ein zweiter Schwerpunkt ist der praxisnahe Einstieg in die Linux-Systemadministration: Auf der Basis des expandierenden Architekturbüros Windschief werden die verschiedensten Serverdienste installiert und konfiguriert, um – je nach Grundszenario – einen kompletten Linux-Server aufzubauen. Hierfür entwirft der Autor drei typische Szenarien, die in der Praxis vorkommen können: Backoffice-Server, Root-Server und Linux als Gateway. Im Rahmen dieser Anwendungsbereiche erläutert der Autor detailliert die benötigten Komponenten. Einzelne Workshops stellen einen konkreten Praxisbezug her. Sie können dieses Buch als Lehrbuch durcharbeiten oder auch langfristig als Nachschlagewerk verwenden, da die einzelnen Themenbereiche klar voneinander abgegrenzt sind. Weil die meisten Bestandteile eines Linux-Systems wie der Kernel, die Shell, die Linux-Befehle sowie der Einsatz von Samba, Apache etc. distributionsübergreifend sind, ist auch der größte Teil des Buches distributionsübergreifend einsetzbar und nur ein sehr geringer Teil Debian-spezifisch. Über den Autor: Eric Amberg arbeitet seit über 15 Jahren in großen Unternehmen im Bereich IT-Security und System- und Netzwerkadministration. Er verfügt über zahlreiche Zertifizierungen, u.a. LPIC-2, RHCE, Cisco CCNP und CISSP. Darüber hinaus ist er MCITP Enterprise Administrator sowie Microsoft Certified Trainer und zertifizierter Cisco Trainer (CCSI).

Each chapter presents examples of different attacks conducted against Web sites. The methodology behind the attack is explored, showing its potential impact. Then, the chapter moves on to address possible countermeasures for different aspects of the attack. The book consists of seven chapters that cover the following: the most pervasive and easily exploited vulnerabilities in Web sites and Web browsers; Structured Query Language (SQL) injection attacks; mistakes of server administrators that expose the Web site to attack; brute force attacks; and logic attacks. The ways in which malicious software malware has been growing as a threat on the Web are also discussed. This book is intended for anyone who uses the Web to check e-mail, shop, or work. Web application developers and security professionals will benefit from the technical details and methodology behind the Web attacks covered in this book. Executive level management will benefit from understanding the threats to a Web site, and in many cases, how a simple attack requiring nothing more than a Web browser can severely impact a site.

Beers, CLI","publish_date":"2011-02-09","description":"Legal investigators are responsible for providing factual evidence – as the fact finders, they are the foundation for the attorneys they work with daily. The attorney is responsible for forming and implementing the legal strategy and presenting it to the judge or jury. The legal investigator provides checks and balances to ensure that no evidence is being forced upon a theory, and that no theory is being forced upon the evidence. Practical Methods for Legal Investigations: Concepts and Protocols in Civil and Criminal Cases presents legal investigators with a step-by-step process that reveals how to methodically find and report evidence in every aspect of the investigative process. Similar to the scientific principle of using research to prove or disprove a theory, the author’s Investigative Protocol is designed to find the facts that prove or disprove criminal charges, civil allegations, or elements thereof. The book includes case studies that clearly detail how the process of the Investigative Protocol applies to every assignment of the case and to the case as a whole. Comprehensive and methodical, the system provides a map to the truth. Readers can discuss the book on the Yahoo Group Practical Methods for Legal Investigations.

Coding - The ability to program and script is quickly becoming a mainstream requirement for just about everyone in the security industry. This section covers the basics in coding complemented with a slue of programming tips and tricks in C/C++, Java, Perl and NASL. 2. Sockets - The technology that allows programs and scripts to communicate over a network is sockets. Even though the theory remains the same - communication over TCP and UDP, sockets are implemented differently in nearly ever language. 3. Shellcode - Shellcode, commonly defined as bytecode converted from Assembly, is utilized to execute commands on remote systems via direct memory access. 4. Porting - Due to the differences between operating platforms and language implementations on those platforms, it is a common practice to modify an original body of code to work on a different platforms. This technique is known as porting and is incredible useful in the real world environments since it allows you to not “recreate the wheel. 5. Coding Tools - The culmination of the previous four sections, coding tools brings all of the techniques that you have learned to the forefront. With the background technologies and techniques you will now be able to code quick utilities that will not only make you more productive, they will arm you with an extremely valuable skill that will remain with you as long as you make the proper time and effort dedications. *Contains never before seen chapters on writing and automating exploits on windows systems with all-new exploits. *Perform zero-day exploit forensics by reverse engineering malicious code. *Provides working code and scripts in all of the most common programming languages for readers to use TODAY to defend their networks.","publisher":"Syngress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZNI5dvBSfZoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":700,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZNI5dvBSfZoC&dq=perl,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":4.5,"ratings_count":3,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZNI5dvBSfZoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=perl,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=244&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781430200536","title":"Beginning MapServer: Open Source GIS Development","author":"Bill Kropla","publish_date":"2006-11-05","description":"* The first book to cover MapServer. * Shows readers how to build dynamic maps using popular open source languages including PHP, Perl and Python. * Shows readers how to pull map information from a MySQL database, to build data-driven mapping applications.","publisher":"Apress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EnoD9fQVmOkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":448,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EnoD9fQVmOkC&dq=perl,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":3.0,"ratings_count":5,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EnoD9fQVmOkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=perl,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=245&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781931769044","title":"Creating Your Web Site with PHP","author":"Dmitriy Koterov","publish_date":"2002","description":"Intended to get programmers up and running quickly, this tutorial looks at Web programming technology using the most recent version of the PHP language to write Web scripts, create Web pages, and design entire sites.

Downey","publish_date":"2009-03-20","description":"The Little Book of Semaphores is a textbook that introduces the principles of synchronization for concurrent programming. In most computer science curricula, synchronization is a module in an Operating Systems class. OS textbooks present a standard set of problems with a standard set of solutions, but most students don't get a good understanding of the material or the ability to solve similar problems. The approach of this book is to identify patterns that are useful for a variety of synchronization problems and then show how they can be assembled into solutions. After each problem, the book offers a hint before showing a solution, giving students a better chance of discovering solutions on their own. The book covers the classical problems, including \"Readers-writers,\" \"Producer-consumer,\" and \"Dining Philosophers.\" In addition, it collects a number of not-so-classical problems. *** Published under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License.
