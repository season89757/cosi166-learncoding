Paul Vick, the father of Visual Basic .NET, explains the whys and hows of this exciting new language better than any other human being on the planet.” —Ted Pattison, Barracuda.NET “The Visual Basic .NET Programming Language includes nuances that in all my use and study of VB .NET, I haven’t seen discussed anywhere else. For example, I learned that you can use the Imports statement to import an Enum name, so that you needn’t refer to the enum in all its uses. In addition, I learned that the dictionary lookup operator, ‘!’, works in VB .NET—I thought this one had been retired. In any case, if you’re searching for a book that covers all the language syntax issues, and more, Paul Vick’s book is a great place to look.” —Ken Getz, Senior Consultant, MCW Technologies, LLC “This book is an excellent stepping stone for Visual Basic developers wanting to get their toes wet in the .NET waters. Paul’s presentation of the core topics all VB developers should tackle first is clear, concise, and unlike other books in the genre, does not overwhelm the reader. The VB6 vs. VB.NET task-oriented approach guides you through the new language and OO features, and then moves to basic threading and other CLR topics—as well as to the key points in the COM to .NET transition—in a well thought-out sequence. If you’ve been holding out on VB .NET, this is a great book to get you started.” —Klaus H. Probst, Sr. Consultant/Architect, Spherion Technology Services, Microsoft MVP “There is no shortage of VB .NET books in the market, but this is the only book straight from the creators. While that is an excellent reason in itself for reading this book, it is the brevity and clarity of the content, along with the examples, that makes this book a must-have.” —Amit Kalani, Developer “Overall, I liked this book and it definitely benefited me. I learned new things I didn’t see anywhere else and I’ll certainly put these to good use in the future. Paul’s book makes a great reference manual for intermediate and advanced VB .NET developers.” —Philip Williams, System Engineer, LDC Direct “This book contains a lot of great information I have seen nowhere else and addresses issues that other books do not.” —Ethan Roberts, .NET Architect, General Casualty “This book is full of useful information and provides a good historical background for the Visual Basic .NET Language.” —Dave Vitter, Technical Lead Developer and author of Designing Visual Basic .NET Applications (Coriolis, 2001) The definitive Microsoft Visual Basic .NET reference—authored by Visual Basic .NET’s lead architect If you want to leverage all of VB .NET’s immense power, get this book. It’s the definitive VB .NET reference and tutorial, and the first Visual Basic book written by one of VB .NET’s lead architects. No other book offers this much behind-the-scenes insight about why VB .NET works the way it does, how it evolved, and how you can make the most of it. The Visual Basic .NET Programming Language is a superb learning tool for new VB .NET programmers and a must-have reference for developers at every level. Paul Vick presents precise language descriptions, essential reference materials, practical insights, and hundreds of code samples, straight from Microsoft’s VB .NET design team. Just some of the features include: A history and overview of Visual Basic’s evolution into VB .NET Complete coverage of the language syntax Transitioning from COM to the CLR and leveraging the .NET platform Runtime functions Taking full advantage of VB .NET’s object-oriented features Notes on style, design, and compatibility throughout the text Notes for the advanced user throughout the text Vick exposes VB .NET’s most powerful capabilities with unprecedented depth and clarity, and packs this book with information you simply won’t find anywhere else. Whether you’re an experienced VB .NET programmer, upgrading from earlier versions of Visual Basic, or coming to Visual Basic and .NET for the first time, you’ll find this book indispensable.","publisher":"Addison-Wesley Professional","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ejzRTF2TL6UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":407,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":2,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ejzRTF2TL6UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=visual+basic+.net,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780596004385","title":"Programming Visual Basic .NET","author":"Jesse Liberty","publish_date":"2003","description":"Programming Visual Basic .NET, Second Edition is the complete guide to application development using Visual Basic .NET.

The emphasis of this book is not on the fancy users interface tricks you can perform with VB.NET, but on the fundamentals of writing correct and efficient VB programs. The book provides a number of example programs that illustrate the concepts developed in the text, and the exercises at the end of each chapter help to reinforce the expository material from the chapter. Visual Basic is arguably the most popular computer programming language for application development in the United States and around the world today. Visual Basic is also an excellent language to teach as a \"first\" computer language because of its easy-to-learn syntax and flexibility. This book treats Visual Basic as a serious programming language and not as just another Windows application. One concern that is frequently voiced when discussing the differences between Visual Basic and C+++ is the level of object-oriented programming supported by Visual Basic.

As developers create .NET applications, this book will help them comprehend the capabilities of the existing namespaces in .NET and how to leverage them by extension or reference to create applications ranging from simple to complex. Visual Basic Programmer's Guide to the .NET Framework Class Library covers how to delineate and define the pieces of .NET; how and why .NET was conceived and what this means to VB6/Windows DNA developers; how to execute Windows programming using the .NET namespaces; instructs how to make architecture decisions when using .NET namespaces; provides details about the construction of Web Services and how they communicate with each other; call-outs and highlighted sections illustrate concepts by relating previous VB6/Windows DNA best practices with the new .NET approach. Lars Powers is co-owner of Brilliant Storm, a consulting company that specializes in developing intelligent tools for the .NET world. He has more than 10 years of experience in the software development sector, nearly all of which centers on designing and implementing highly distributed applications using Microsoft VB and COM technologies.

Also covered are instructions for how to greatly increase your graphics capabilities using transformations, which allow you to move, stretch, or rotate graphics. They also let you work in coordinate systems that make sense for your application. The author also describes techniques for using the above in printouts, describing the sequence of events that produce a printout and show how to generate and preview printouts, with examples which show how to wrap long chunks of text across multiple pages, if necessary. In addition, you will learn about two powerful new graphic tools that were introduced with .NET Framework 3.0: WPF graphics and FlowDocuments. XAML graphic commands allow a WPF application to draw and fill the same kinds of shapes that a program can draw by using graphics objects. Finally, a discussion on the FlowDocument object shows you how to define items that should be flowed across multiple pages as space permits. This lets you display text, graphics, controls, and other items that automatically flow across page breaks.

Pro VB 2010 and the .NET 4.0 Platform provides developers with a complete guide to the new technology, explaining the importance of all the key VB 2010 language features. This edition has been comprehensively revised and rewritten to make it accurately reflect the VB 10 language specification for the .NET 4.0 platform. You’ll find new chapters covering the important concepts of dynamic lookups, named and optional arguments, Parallel LINQ (PLINQ), improved COM interop, and variance for generics. The first edition of this book was released at the 2001 Tech-Ed conference in Atlanta, Georgia. At that time, the .NET platform was still a beta product, and in many ways, so was this book. This is not to say that the early editions of this text did not have merit—after all, the book was a 2002 Jolt Award finalist and it won the 2003 Referenceware Excellence Award. However, over the years that author Andrew Troelsen spent working with the common language runtime (CLR), he gained a much deeper understanding of the .NET platform and the subtleties of the VB programming language, and he feels that this sixth edition of the book is as close to a “final release” as he’s come yet! If you’re checking out this book for the first time, do understand that it’s targeted at experienced software professionals and/or graduate students of computer science (so don’t expect three chapters on iteration or decision constructs!). The mission of this text is to provide you with a rock-solid foundation in the VB programming language and the core aspects of the .NET platform (assemblies, remoting, Windows Forms, Web Forms, ADO.NET, XML web services, etc.). Once you digest the information presented in these 25 chapters, you’ll be in a perfect position to apply this knowledge to your specific programming assignments and explore the .NET universe on your own terms. What you’ll learn Discover the ins and outs of the leading .NET technology. Learn from an award-winning author who has been teaching the .NET world since version 1.0. Find complete coverage of the WPF, WCF, and WF foundations that support the core .NET platform. Who this book is for This book is for anyone with some software development experience who is interested in the new .NET Framework 4.0 and the VB language. Whether you are moving to .NET for the first time or are already writing applications on .NET 2.0 or .NET 3.5, this book will provide you with a comprehensive grounding in the new technology and serve as a complete reference throughout your coding career.

The .NET Framework may well have the most comprehensive support for internationalization and globalization of any development platform to date, and .NET Internationalization teaches developers how to unlock and utilize that support. Experienced international application developer Guy Smith-Ferrier covers the internationalization of both Windows Forms and ASP.NET applications, using both Versions 1.1 and 2.0 of the .NET Framework. Smith-Ferrier not only teaches you the best ways to take advantage of the globalization and internationalization features built in to the .NET Framework and Visual Studio, he also provides original code to take globalized applications to the next level of international utility and maintainability. Key topics include • An introduction to the internationalization process and how localization and globalization are supported in Windows and the .NET Framework • The use of resource managers, cultures, resource DLLs, and localized strings, images, and files—including strongly typed resources • Detailed coverage of form localization in Windows Forms and Web Forms • Dealing with regional cultures and their casing, collation, and calendars • Managing right-to-left Middle-Eastern text and pictographic East Asian languages • How to use the book’s original resource administration utilities • How to translate resources with machine translation • How to create custom cultures and integrate them with the .NET Framework 2.0 and Visual Studio 2005 • How resource managers work and how to write custom resource managers, including a resource manager that uses a database • How to test your internationalization with FxCop using new and existing globalization rules • How to effectively include the translator in the internationalization process Whether you are a developer, architect, or manager, if you are involved in international applications with the .NET Framework, this is the one book you need to read and understand before you start development. Guy Smith-Ferrier is an author, developer, trainer, and speaker with more than 20 years of software engineering experience. He has internationalized applications in four development platforms, including the .NET Framework. A frequent conference speaker, Guy is the author of C# and .NET courseware and has written numerous articles.

Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET) is an object-oriented computer programming language. It is an extension of the BASIC programming language that combines BASIC functions and commands with visual controls. Visual Basic provides a graphical user interface GUI that allows the developer to drag and drop objects into the program as well as manually write program code. Visual Basic is designed to make software development easy and efficient, while still being powerful enough to create advanced programs. For example, the Visual Basic language is designed to be \"human readable,\" which means the source code can be understood without requiring lots of comments. Programs created with Visual Basic can be designed to run on Windows, on the Web, within Office applications, or on mobile devices. Visual Studio .NET provides development tools to create programs based on the .NET framework, such as ASP.NET applications, which are often deployed on the Web.","publisher":"Course Technology Ptr","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t4ULAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":799,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t4ULAAAACAAJ&dq=visual+basic+.net,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=134&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781576109618","title":"Visual Basic .NET Programming, with: Peter Aitken","author":"Peter G.

The latest version, VB 2008, is even more useful -- and provides even more incentive for migrating from VB 6. All it lacks is a good book on how to harness its power. Programming Visual Basic 2008 fills the void. Written in a lively and engaging style by a developer who's grown up with Visual Basic, including both VB 6 and VB .NET, this hands-on guide addresses the core topics of the new VB, from basic to complex, with plenty of code examples. Programming Visual Basic 2008 also examines .NET programming from the application level with a chapter-by-chapter plan for developing, documenting, and deploying a full data-driven application. You learn, step-by-step, how to build and deploy a library management system, complete with patron, inventory, and barcode support. The book's broad range of topics include: VB language and its syntax An overview of the .NET Framework Object-oriented development in VB and .NET Generic objects, collections, and nullable types Design and management of software projects Integrating desktop features with Windows Forms Database design with SQL Server 2008 Database interface design with ADO.NET The new LINQ feature, and how to use it within VB and .NET Embedding XML within application source code Encryption and authentication in .NET Interacting with data stored in files and directories Web development using ASP.NET Deploying an application to a user's workstation And much more Programming Visual Basic 2008 is ideal for VB 6 programmers who are ready to move to .NET, as well as VB.NET programmers who wish to improve their project-focused software development skills. Programming novices and developers coming from other languages will find the book valuable because of its language instruction and project design knowledge. Once you finish the book, you will have a firm grasp of VB 2008's core concepts and language elements, and understand how to build VB projects as they were intended -- as complete, cohesive solutions.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mggpAr3fskEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":784,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mggpAr3fskEC&dq=visual+basic+.net,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mggpAr3fskEC&pg=PA303&dq=visual+basic+.net,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=146&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781932111682","title":"Visual Basic.

It is aimed at first level students at universities and colleges, but it is also suitable for novices studying alone.Visual Basic.Net is a fully-fledged object-oriented language, supporting encapsulation, single inheritance and polymorphism. In creating Visual Basic.Net, Microsoft have made VisualBasic into an elegant and consistent language. These features all make the language easier to learn, easier to use and more robust. In addition it encourages the use of good programmingstyle. Visual Basic.Net is part of a suite of tools associated with the .Net architecture, but it is also a free-standing programming language. It can be used to write free-standing program code or to create components that fit within the .Net architecture.The authors explain how to use objects early in this book, starting with the ideas of variables, assignment and methods, then introducing using library classes. Next they explain how to use control structures for selection and looping and then comes the treatment of how to write your own classes.The book ensures that the fun element of programming is paramount, so graphics are used right from the start.

WPF combines the best of Windows and the Web; fully integrates user interfaces, documents, and media; and leverages the full power of XML-based declarative programming. In Essential Windows Presentation Foundation, former WPF architect Chris Anderson systematically introduces this breakthrough platform, focusing on the concepts and techniques working developers need in order to build robust applications for real users. Drawing on his unique experience as an architect on the team, Anderson thoroughly illuminates the crucial new concepts underlying WPF and reveals how its APIs work together to offer developers unprecedented value. Through working sample code, you’ll discover how WPF draws on the Web’s simple models for markup and deployment, common frame for applications, and rich server connectivity, and on Windows’ rich client model, simple programming model, strong control over look-and-feel, and rich networking.

As of March 2005, Microsoft no longer supports this version of Visual Basic. And you can't blame them. Three years ago, they introduced the .NET Framework--an elegant, powerful platform--along with the new component-based VB.NET language. But roughly five million of you decided to stick with VB6, mostly to maintain legacy Windows and COM projects. Now, with the upcoming release of VB 2005, Microsoft has several attractive reasons to upgrade that you'll find hard to resist, including the return of some VB6 features. And we have the perfect book to help you make the conversion: Visual Basic 2005 Jumpstart. Now, you can test-drive the beta version of VB 2005 with three hands-on projects that enable you to learn the syntax of this new language quickly. VB 2005 not only lets you convert the bulk of your existing VB6 code, but offers several familiar features, such as compile-and-run debugging, new MyClasses that simplify use of .NET libraries and frameworks, lots of IDE support for Windows, web and mobile GUI development, and data access controls that closely resemble what you use now. The real plus is that you'll be using these features with the .NET platform, which is more secure, less complex than COM, and offers OneClick deployment. Visual Basic 2005 Jumpstart lets you get the feel of this platform for building smart/rich Windows Forms clients, ASP.NET web applications, and web services. Author Wei-Meng Lee, a Microsoft .NET MVP, veteran O'Reilly author and frequent contributor to the O'Reilly Network, has put together three useful test-drive projects, complete with code samples, that let you develop: A personal library Windows application A Web-based shopping cart application A stock enquiry Web Service Our jumpstart guide is the quick, painless way to migrate from VB6 to VB 2005, and the perfect training manual for moving your organization to the more robust, dynamic and secure world of .NET.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fTs_pppg5PoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":216,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fTs_pppg5PoC&dq=visual+basic+.net,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fTs_pppg5PoC&pg=PA29&dq=visual+basic+.net,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=217&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":null,"title":"Visual Basic 4 API How-to: The Definitive Guide to Using the Win32 API with Visual Basic 4","author":"Noel Jerke, Eric Brierley","publish_date":"1996-01-01","description":"Clear, concise, and well-explained examples show Visual Basic programmers how to optimize their work with Windows API.

Do you want to employ object–oriented programming techniques in a distributed environment? Do you want to maximize the reuse and maintainability of your code? Then this book is for you. In Rockford Lhotka's Expert VB 2008 Business Objects, you'll learn how to use advanced .NET Framework capabilities alongside object-oriented design and programming to create scalable, maintainable object–oriented applications. Better still, this book includes Component-based Scalable Logical Architecture (CSLA) .NET 3.6, a widely-used framework on which you can base your application development. By using the concepts and framework in the book, you can focus more on your business issues, and less on technology. Having updated this third edition using Visual Studio 2008 and Visual Basic 2008, Rockford Lhotka shows you how CSLA .NET 3.6 allows great flexibility in object persistence, so business objects can use virtually any data sources available. The CSLA framework supports 1–, 2–, and n–tier models through the concept of mobile objects. This provides the flexibility to optimize performance, scalability, security, and fault tolerance with no changes to code in the user interface or business objects. Business objects based on CSLA .NET 3.6 automatically gain many advanced features that simplify the creation of Windows forms, web forms, WPF, WCF, WF and Web Services interfaces, and LINQ.","publisher":"Apress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K-2THL95yRIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":750,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K-2THL95yRIC&dq=visual+basic+.net,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K-2THL95yRIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=visual+basic+.net,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=237&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780764568855","title":"Beginning ASP.NET 1.1 with VB.NET 2003","author":"Chris Ullman, John Kauffman, Chris Hart, David Sussman","publish_date":"2004-02-15","description":null,"publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HZixgo6xs-4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":886,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HZixgo6xs-4C&dq=visual+basic+.net,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HZixgo6xs-4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=visual+basic+.net,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=238&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780072195132","title":"ASP.NET: The Complete Reference","author":"Matthew MacDonald","publish_date":"2002","description":"This guide is a comprehensive reference for Web developers at all levels.

Writing secure .NET code requires three things: an understanding of the .NET code security system, attention to detail, and the ability to think from the point of view of an attacker. Many security vulnerabilities in fact have little to do with the security system but rather are a result of treating hostile input as non-hostile. This book is a practical reference of the .NET security framework, and demonstrates best practices that will go a long way towards making your code secure in the face of attacks.

Indeed, this is already happening. While several finance books provide C++ code for pricing derivatives and performing numerical calculations, none approaches the topic from a system design perspective. This book will be divided into two sections-programming techniques and automated trading system ( ATS ) technology-and teach financial system design and development from the absolute ground up using Microsoft Visual C++.NET 2005. MS Visual C++.NET 2005 has been chosen as the implementation language primarily because most trading firms and large banks have developed and continue to develop their proprietary algorithms in ISO C++ and Visual C++.NET provides the greatest flexibility for incorporating these legacy algorithms into working systems. Furthermore, the .NET Framework and development environment provide the best libraries and tools for rapid development of trading systems. The first section of the book explains Visual C++.NET 2005 in detail and focuses on the required programming knowledge for automated trading system development, including object oriented design, delegates and events, enumerations, random number generation, timing and timer objects, and data management with STL.NET and .NET collections. Furthermore, since most legacy code and modeling code in the financial markets is done in ISO C++, this book looks in depth at several advanced topics relating to managed/unmanaged/COM memory management and interoperability. Further, this book provides dozens of examples illustrating the use of database connectivity with ADO.NET and an extensive treatment of SQL and FIX and XML/FIXML. Advanced programming topics such as threading, sockets, as well as using C++.NET to connect to Excel are also discussed at length and supported by examples. The second section of the book explains technological concerns and design concepts for automated trading systems. Specifically, chapters are devoted to handling real-time data feeds, managing orders in the exchange order book, position selection, and risk management. A .dll is included in the book that will emulate connection to a widely used industry API ( Trading Technologies, Inc.’s XTAPI ) and provide ways to test position and order management algorithms. Design patterns are presented for market taking systems based upon technical analysis as well as for market making systems using intermarket spreads. As all of the chapters revolve around computer programming for financial engineering and trading system development, this book will educate traders, financial engineers, quantitative analysts, students of quantitative finance and even experienced programmers on technological issues that revolve around development of financial applications in a Microsoft environment and the construction and implementation of real-time trading systems and tools. * Teaches financial system design and development from the ground up using Microsoft Visual C++.NET 2005. * Provides dozens of examples illustrating the programming approaches in the book * Chapters are supported by screenshots, equations, sample Excel spreadsheets, and programming code","publisher":"Academic Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zQLpvF_xRw0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":336,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zQLpvF_xRw0C&dq=visual+basic+.net,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":3.0,"ratings_count":2,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zQLpvF_xRw0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=visual+basic+.net,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=266&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781430201656","title":"Expert VB 2005 Business Objects","author":"Rockford Lhotka","publish_date":"2006-11-24","description":"Popular conference speaker \"Rocky\" Lhotka shows how to use the framework to create a sample application and demonstrates how easy it is to write Windows, Web, and Web services interfaces for applications based on it.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-cRCAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":720,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-cRCAAAAQBAJ&dq=visual+basic+.net,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=267&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781590590515","title":".NET Game Programming with DirectX 9.0","author":"Alexandre Santos Lobao, Ellen Hatton","publish_date":"2003-04-07","description":"Written in easy-to-understand language, this book is a must-read if you'd like to create out-of-the-ordinary, yet simple games.

Organizations create add-ins for many purposes: to speed common tasks, to ease code reuse within an organization, and to enforce rules and consistency among developers. Effective use of add-ins can dramatically improve developer efficiency and reduce costs. Writing Add-Ins for Visual Studio .NET is designed to get add-in developers up to speed in developing ad-ins in Visual Studio .NET and to teach add-in development to developers who want to learn to write add-ins. Author Les Smith also provides enough real code examples to challenge even experienced add-in developers. Smiths book begins by teaching readers how to use the Add-In Wizard to create the basic add-in framework. From there, he covers the manipulation of code in windows and controls, and the manipulation of projects. Writing Add-Ins for Visual Studio .NET explores in detail, how to create an add-in user interface, including toolbars, toolbar buttons, and multiple-level menus, as well as how to create a user interface in the system tray. Smith also addresses the migration of add-ins from VB 6.0 to VB .NET for those developers who have previous experience in writing add-ins. One of the great challenges that add-in developers will encounter is finding the right classes from among the 3,400 classes in the .NET Framework. Smith teaches and demonstrates use of the Visual Studio add-in object model to show readers how to use the methods and properties and respond to events in order to enhance the power of the integrated development environment (IDE).","publisher":"Apress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-XVRb4u-BKQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":552,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-XVRb4u-BKQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=visual+basic+.net,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=296&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781593270742","title":"The Book of Visual Basic 2005: NET Insight for Classic VB Developers","author":"Matthew MacDonald","publish_date":"2006","description":"From the author of the highly acclaimed Book of VB .NET comes this comprehensive introduction to Visual Basic 2005, the newest version of Microsoft’s popular programming language.

In Microsoft Office Programming: A Guide for Experienced Developers, Stephens skips the tiresome explanations of variable declarations and dives right into serious Office programming topics, such as automatically customizing menus and toolbars with VBA, making Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) do your work for you, and using ADO to manipulate data in an Access database.","publisher":"Apress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rWT3_HC7i_MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":736,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rWT3_HC7i_MC&pg=PR17&dq=visual+basic+.net,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=301&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9788883314179","title":"Programmazione avanzata con Microsoft Visual Basic .Net","author":"Jeffrey Richter, Francesco Balena","publish_date":"2002","description":null,"publisher":null,"image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5z76PAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":640,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5z76PAAACAAJ&dq=visual+basic+.net,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=302&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780130425300","title":"The Complete Visual Basic .

Un lenguaje que puede utilizarse igualmente como lenguaje de script en páginas ASP.NET, en la creación de interfaces de usuario, componentes y servicios Web. Si, como programador, usa habitualmente el lenguaje C++ para desarrollar sobre Windows, indudablemente le interesará conocer C# y sus nuevas posibilidades. Por decirlo coloquialmente, con C# se sentirá como en casa gracias a que la sintaxis es muy cercana a C++ pero, al tiempo, tendrá la seguridad de que muchos problemas de este lenguaje no los encontrará en C#. Prácticamente lo mismo podría decirse si usa para sus desarrollos el lenguaje Java. Con el libro \" Visual C# .NET \" , podrá seguir procedimientos prácticos para familiarizarse básicamente con el entorno de trabajo y los fundamentos del funcionamiento de la plataforma. En los distintos capítulos aprenderá a utilizar, desde Visual C#, ADO.NET para trabajar con datos procedentes de bases de datos como SQL Server, GDI+ con el fin de crear gráficos, manipular imágenes o imprimir información, ASP.NET para diseñar interfaces de usuario y servicios Web, Crystal Reports.NET con el fin de crear informes, etc. También aprenderá a crear aplicaciones, sin importar su tipo, usando múltiples hilos de ejecución concurrentes, reutilizando componentes COM heredados de proyectos previos o accediendo a los servicios nativos del API de Windows.

Shoemaker","publish_date":"2004-03-25","description":"UML Applied: A .NET Perspective is the first book to examine the two worlds of Unified Modeling Language (UML) and .NET concurrently. The core of this book provides a set of proven, hands-on, team-oriented exercises that will have you solving real-world problems with UML faster than when using any other approach—often in under a day. Author Martin Shoemaker also demonstrates how to use Rational XDE for effective model-driven development. From the author: “In teaching UML to my students, nothing has been as effective as 'Five-Step UML,' a process I devised by stripping away, one piece at a time, everything that got in the way of learning UML. Eventually, I was left with five simple, clear steps that show the students why and how to use UML, by having them start the class by actually solving problems with UML. After they learn the why and the how, they're motivated to learn the what: the details of the UML notation. And they have a lot of fun in the process. Now 'Im using Five-Step UML to teach .NET analysis and design in a larger framework. I call it model-driven development—UML models as the central artifacts of the development process, with other artifacts (code, tests, documents, even estimates and schedules) all deriving from the models. With this book, I've collected my Five-Step UML and model-driven development thoughts into one complete package. I also give a UML perspective of the .NET Common Language Runtime and the .NET Framework, providing a graphical overview that complements the online help.”","publisher":"Apress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=i-E8D_Q2EZAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":560,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i-E8D_Q2EZAC&pg=PA139&dq=visual+basic+.net,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=339&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780470938966","title":"Access 2010 Programmer's Reference","author":"Teresa Hennig, Rob Cooper, Geoffrey L.
