[{"isbn":"9780080471594","title":"Groovy Programming: An Introduction for Java Developers","author":"Kenneth Barclay, John Savage","publish_date":"2010-07-27","description":"Groovy Programming is an introduction to the Java-based scripting language Groovy. Groovy has much in common with popular scripting languages such as Perl, Python, and Ruby, but is written in a Java-like syntax. And, unlike these other languages, Groovy is sanctioned by the Java community for use on the Java platform. Since it is based on Java, applications written in Groovy can make full use of the Java Application Programmer Interfaces (APIs). This means Groovy can integrate seamlessly with applications written in Java, while avoiding the complexities of the full Java language. This bare-bones structure also means Groovy can be used as an introduction to Java and to programming in general. Its simpler constructions and modern origins make it ideal as a first language and for introducing principles such as object-oriented programming. This book introduces all the major aspects of Groovy development and emphasizes Groovy's potential as a learning tool. Case studies and exercises are included, along with numerous programming examples. The book begins assuming only a general familiarity with Java programming, and progresses to discuss advanced topics such as GUI builders, Groovlets, Unit Testing, and Groovy SQL. * The first comprehensive book on Groovy programming that shows how writing applications and scripts for the Java platform is fast and easy * Written by leading software engineers and acclaimed computing instructors * Offers numerous programming examples, code samples, detailed case studies, exercises for self-study, and a companion website with a Windows-based Groovy editor","publisher":"Morgan Kaufmann","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kV8GYTCDf9AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":496,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kV8GYTCDf9AC&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":5,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kV8GYTCDf9AC&printsec=frontcover&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781847196910","title":"Groovy for Domain-Specific Languages","author":"Fergal Dearle","publish_date":"2010-06-01","description":"Extend and enhance your Java applications with Domain Specific Languages in Groovy.","publisher":"Packt Publishing Ltd","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=egRd1BqPw7MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":312,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=egRd1BqPw7MC&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=egRd1BqPw7MC&printsec=frontcover&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781430248071","title":"Beginning Groovy, Grails and Griffon","author":"Christopher M Judd, Joseph Faisal Nusairat, Jim Shingler, Vishal Layka","publish_date":"2013-03-12","description":"Web frameworks are playing a major role in the creation of today's most compelling web applications, because they automate many of the tedious tasks, allowing developers to instead focus on providing users with creative and powerful features.

Published with the developer in mind, firstPress technical briefs explore emerging technologies that have the potential to be critical for tomorrow's industry. Apress keeps developers one step ahead by presenting key information as early as possible in a PDF of 150 pages or less. Explore the future through Apress with Grails Persistence with GORM and GSQL. This firstPress book covers Grails persistence with GORM, from defining your first model to the nature of transactions and advanced Hibernate querying. Other APIs and tools such as GSQL (Groovy SQL) are covered as well, as needed, to empower your Grails persistence efforts.","publisher":"Apress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jEaXDlaQVRMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":125,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jEaXDlaQVRMC&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jEaXDlaQVRMC&pg=PA141&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=21&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9783955616038","title":"Groovy – kurz & gut","author":"Jörg Staudemeyer","publish_date":"2014-07-24","description":"Groovy ist eine dynamische Programmiersprache für die JVM, die unter Java-Entwicklern immer beliebter wird.

The concepts within Grails, like interceptors, tag libs, and Groovy Server Pages (GSP), make those in the Java community feel right at home. Grails’ foundation is on solid open source technologies such as Spring, Hibernate, and SiteMesh, which gives it even more potential in the Java space: Spring provides powerful inversion of control and MVC, Hibernate brings a stable, mature object relational mapping technology with the ability to integrate with legacy systems, and SiteMesh handles flexible layout control and page decoration. Grails complements these with additional features that take advantage of the coding–by–convention paradigm such as dynamic tag libraries, Grails object relational mapping, Groovy Server Pages, and scaffolding. Graeme Rocher, Grails lead and founder, and Jeff Brown bring you completely up–to–date with their authoritative and fully comprehensive guide to the Grails 2 framework. You’ll get to know all the core features, services, and Grails extensions via plug–ins, and understand the roles that Groovy and Grails are playing in the changing Web.","publisher":"Apress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n0zSKp4MA5sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":360,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n0zSKp4MA5sC&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":2.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n0zSKp4MA5sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781783554843","title":"ElasticSearch Cookbook - Second Edition","author":"Alberto Paro","publish_date":"2015-01-28","description":"If you are a developer who implements ElasticSearch in your web applications and want to sharpen your understanding of the core elements and applications, this is the book for you.

Intelligent virtual agents (IVAs) are interactive characters that exhibit hum- like qualities and communicate with humans or with each other using natural human modalities such as speech and gesture. They are capable of real-time perception, cognition and action, allowing them to participate in a dynamic physical and social environment. IVA is an interdisciplinary annual conference and the main forum for p- senting research on modeling, developing and evaluating IVAs with a focus on communicative abilities and social behavior. The development of IVAs requires expertise in multimodal interaction and several AI ?elds such as cognitive m- eling, planning, vision and natural language processing. Computational models are typically based on experimental studies and theories of human–human and human–robot interaction; conversely, IVA technology may provide interesting lessons for these ?elds. The realization of engaging IVAs is a challenging task, so reusable modules and tools are of great value. The ?elds of application range from robot assistants, social simulation and tutoring to games and artistic - ploration.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yZzlcHnxC0cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":571,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yZzlcHnxC0cC&pg=PA104&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781783280568","title":"Hudson 3 Essentials","author":"Lloyd Meinholz","publish_date":"2013-12-11","description":"A practical guide, packed with illustrations, that will help you become proficient with Hudson and able to utilize it how you want.

Using the JavaTM platform’s new scripting support, you can improve efficiency, streamline your development processes, and solve problems ranging from prototyping to Web application programming. In Scripting in Java, Dejan Bosanac covers key aspects of scripting with Java, from the exciting new Groovy scripting language to Java’s new Scripting and Web Scripting APIs. Bosanac begins by reviewing the role and value of scripting languages, and then systematically introduces today’s best scripting solutions for the Java platform. He introduces Java scripting frameworks, identifies proven patterns for integrating scripting into Java applications, and presents practical techniques for everything from unit testing to project builds. He supports key concepts with extensive code examples that demonstrate scripting at work in real-world Java projects.

An experimental evaluation of static and dynamic type systems","author":"Sebastian Kleinschmager","publish_date":"2013-06-01","description":"Programming languages that use the object-oriented approach have been around for quite a while now. Most of them use either a static or a dynamic type system. However, both types are very common in the industry. But, in spite of their common use in science and practice, only very few scientific studies have tried to evaluate the two type systems' usefulness in certain scenarios. There are arguments for both systems. For example, static type systems are said to aid the programmer in the prevention of type errors, and further, they provide documentation help for, there is an explicit need to annotate variables and methods with their respective types. This book describes a controlled experiment that was conducted to shed some light into the presented matter. Which of the type systems can live up to its promises? Is one of these better suited for a particular task? And which type system is the most supportive in a problem solving? The main hypothesis claims that a static type system is faster in a problem solving in use of an undocumented API. Thus, in the study, the participants need to solve different programming tasks in an undocumented API environment with the help of the static type system (Java), and the dynamic type system (Groovy). The author starts with a short introduction to the topic, the experimentation, and the motivation. Then, he describes a list of related works, and proceeds to the description of the experiment, its evaluation, and finally, the discussion of the results. This book should prove interesting reading for anyone who is interested in the mechanics that drive programmer productivity and performance that depend on the kind of technology used, as well as for anyone who might be interested in empirical research in software engineering, in general.","publisher":"Anchor Academic Publishing (aap_verlag)","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bTi5BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":113,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bTi5BgAAQBAJ&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bTi5BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA81&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=33&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781430307822","title":"Getting Started with Grails","author":"Jason Rudolph","publish_date":"2007-02-01","description":"Grails is an open-source, rapid web application development framework that provides a super-productive full-stack programming model based on the Groovy scripting language and built on top of Spring, Hibernate, and other standard Java frameworks.

But that ambition is often dangerous! Too often, budding indie developers and hobbyists bite off more than they can chew. Some of the most popular games in recent memory – Doodle Jump, Paper Toss, and Canabalt, to name a few – have been fun, simple games that have delighted players and delivered big profits to their creators. This is the perfect climate for new game developers to succeed by creating simple games with Unity 3D, starting today. This book starts you off on the right foot, emphasizing small, simple game ideas and playable projects that you can actually finish. The complexity of the games increases gradually as we progress through the chapters. The chosen examples help you learn a wide variety of game development techniques. With this understanding of Unity 3D and bite-sized bits of programming, you can make your own mark on the game industry by finishing fun, simple games. This book shows you how to build crucial game elements that you can reuse and re-skin in many different games, using the phenomenal (and free!) Unity 3D game engine. It initiates you into indie game culture by teaching you how to make your own small, simple games using Unity3D and some gentle, easy-to-understand code. It will help you turn a rudimentary keep-up game into a madcap race through hospital hallways to rush a still-beating heart to the transplant ward, program a complete 2D game using Unity's User Interface controls, put a dramatic love story spin on a simple catch game, and turn that around into a classic space shooter with spectacular explosions and \"pew\" sounds! By the time you're finished, you'll have learned to develop a number of important pieces to create your own games that focus in on that small, singular piece of joy that makes games fun. This book shoots straight for the heart of fun, simple game design and keeps shooting until you have all the pieces you need to assemble your own great games.","publisher":"Packt Publishing Ltd","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vFMggPqVnhcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":364,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vFMggPqVnhcC&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":2.5,"ratings_count":5,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vFMggPqVnhcC&pg=PT9&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781593271879","title":"How to be a Geek Goddess: Practical Advice for Using Computers with Smarts and Style","author":"Christina Tynan-Wood","publish_date":"2008-11-01","description":"Provides information for women on computer technology, covering such topics as purchasing a computer, hardware and software, online shopping, wireless networking, security, and social networking.","publisher":"No Starch Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xyWKBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":344,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xyWKBAAAQBAJ&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xyWKBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA243&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=41&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781449324537","title":"Programming Grails","author":"Burt Beckwith","publish_date":"2013-04-23","description":"Dig deeper into Grails architecture and discover how this application framework works its magic.

Gerade in der Softwareentwicklung erfreuen sie sich großer Beliebtheit und so steigt die Zahl der Projekte, in denen Scrum, Extreme Programming, Kanban oder ähnliche Vorgehensmodelle zum Einsatz kommen. Kunden und Dienstleister versprechen sich hierdurch bessere Produkte und kürzere Entwicklungszyklen. Es soll möglichst schnell ein potenziell auslieferbares Produkt entstehen, das dann nach und nach verbessert und angepasst werden kann. Den Softwareentwicklern kommt in diesem Zuge ein hohes Maß an zusätzlicher Freiheit und Verantwortung zu. Sie treffen sich regelmäßig mit dem Kunden zu Rückschau und Planung, arbeiten mit diversen Backlogs und kommen zum täglichen Stand-Up-Meeting zusammen. Doch außerhalb dieser vorgegeben Methoden kann die Agilität rasch verfliegen, da weiterhin mit unflexiblen Werkzeugen und Frameworks gearbeitet werden muss. Gerade bei der Entwicklung von Web-Anwendungen im Java-Umfeld sind meist erhebliche Vorarbeiten und Konfigurationen notwendig, bevor überhaupt mit der eigentlichen Entwicklung begonnen werden kann. Mit der Sprache Groovy und dem darauf aufsetzenden Web-Application-Framework Grails soll die Entwicklung in der Java-Welt deutlich agiler werden. Ob dies zutrifft und wie dies funktionieren kann, soll diese Arbeit darlegen. Dazu sollen zunächst die Eigenschaften einiger agile Vorgehensmodelle sowie Groovy und Grails vorgestellt werden. Es folgt eine Analyse, wie Grails die Entwicklung in agilen Projekten unterstützen kann sowie ein Blick auf mögliche Grenzen des Einsatzes.","publisher":"GRIN Verlag","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5n79JUBJVoQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":23,"written_language":"de","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5n79JUBJVoQC&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5n79JUBJVoQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=54&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781430261520","title":"Pro Spring","author":"Clarence Ho, Rob Harrop, Chris Schaefer","publish_date":"2014-09-16","description":"Pro Spring updates the perennial bestseller with the latest that the Spring Framework 4 has to offer.

These new changes make their debut in Java 8, and their highlight is the long-awaited support for lambda expressions in the Java language. You’ll learn to write lambda expressions and use them to create functional interfaces and default methods for evolving APIs, among many other uses. The changes in Java 8 are significant. Syntax and usage of the language are changed considerably with the introduction of closures and lambda expressions. This book takes you through these important changes from introduction to mastery. Through a set of clear examples, you’ll learn to refactor existing code to take advantage of the new language features. You’ll learn what those features can do for you, and when they are best applied. You’ll learn to design and write new code having these important new features in mind from the very beginning. Clearly explains the fantastic benefits resulting from Project Lambda Explains the syntax and IDE support for the new features Shows how to streamline your code by bringing some of the benefits of functional programming to the Java language Illustrates parallelism in closures through Stream and Spliterator objects Explains API evolution by adding methods to existing interfaces without breaking existing interface implementations, a technique addressing potential multiple inheritance issues","publisher":"Apress","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2QfzBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":220,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2QfzBgAAQBAJ&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2QfzBgAAQBAJ&pg=PP4&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=58&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9783642190476","title":"Community-Built Databases: Research and Development","author":"Eric Pardede","publish_date":"2011-05-19","description":"Wikipedia, Flickr, You Tube, Facebook, LinkedIn are all examples of large community-built databases, although with quite diverse purposes and collaboration patterns.

In terms of capabilities, Maven is an improvement to Apache Ant-thanks to numerous plug-ins and built-in integration with unit testing frameworks such as JUnit. Tired of writing the same build logic for every project? Using Maven, you can leverage the experience of the community to avoid the tedious process of creating yet another build script for each new project.Maven: A Developer's Notebook begins by introducing you to the concept of project object model (POM), and then offers further details on the essential features of Maven. Like all titles in O'Reilly's Developer's Notebook series, this no-nonsense book skips the boring prose and cuts right to the chase. It's an approach that forces you to get your hands dirty by working through a series of poignant labs-exercises that speak to you instead of at you.Plus, Maven: A Developer's Notebook is the first book on the subject to hit the market, so you know the information is fresh and timely. If you're a Java programmer, you'll be armed with all the critical information you need to get up to speed on this powerful new build tool.

New Java 7 language features that are discussed include switch-on-string and try-with-resources. APIs that are discussed include Threading, the Collections Framework, the Concurrency Utilities, Swing, Java 2D, networking, JDBC, SAX, DOM, StAX, XPath, JAX-WS, and SAAJ. This book also presents an introduction to Android app development so that you can apply some of its knowledge to the exciting world of Android app development. This book presents the following table of contents: Chapter 1 introduces you to Java and begins to cover the Java language by focusing on fundamental concepts such as comments, identifiers, variables, expressions, and statements. Chapter 2 continues to explore this language by presenting all of its features for working with classes and objects. You learn about features related to class declaration and object creation, encapsulation, information hiding, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, and garbage collection. Chapter 3 focuses on the more advanced language features related to nested classes, packages, static imports, exceptions, assertions, annotations, generics, and enums. Additional chapters introduce you to the few features not covered in Chapters 1 through 3. Chapter 4 largely moves away from covering language features (although it does introduce class literals and strictfp) while focusing on language-oriented APIs. You learn about Math, StrictMath, Package, Primitive Type Wrapper Classes, Reference, Reflection, String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder, Threading, BigDecimal, and BigInteger in this chapter. Chapter 5 begins to explore Java's utility APIs by focusing largely on the Collections Framework. However, it also discusses legacy collection-oriented APIs and how to create your own collections. Chapter 6 continues to focus on utility APIs by presenting the concurrency utilities along with the Objects and Random classes. Chapter 7 moves you away from the command-line user interfaces that appear in previous chapters and toward graphical user interfaces. You first learn about the Abstract Window Toolkit foundation, and then explore the Java Foundation Classes in terms of Swing and Java 2D. Appendix C explores Accessibility and Drag and Drop. Chapter 8 explores filesystem-oriented I/O in terms of the File, RandomAccessFile, stream, and writer/reader classes. Chapter 9 introduces you to Java's network APIs (e.g., sockets). It also introduces you to the JDBC API for interacting with databases along with the Java DB database product. Chapter 10 dives into Java's XML support by first presenting an introduction to XML (including DTDs and schemas). It next explores the SAX, DOM, StAX, XPath, and XSLT APIs. It even briefly touches on the Validation API. While exploring XPath, you encounter namespace contexts, extension functions and function resolvers, and variables and variable resolvers. Chapter 11 introduces you to Java's support for SOAP-based and RESTful web services. As well as providing you with the basics of these web service categories, Chapter 11 presents some advanced topics, such as working with the SAAJ API to communicate with a SOAP-based web service without having to rely on JAX-WS. You will appreciate having learned about XML in Chapter 10 before diving into this chapter. Chapter 12 helps you put to use some of the knowledge you've gathered in previous chapters by showing you how to use Java to write an Android app's source code. This chapter introduces you to Android, discusses its architecture, shows you how to install necessary tools, and develops a simple app. Appendix A presents the solutions to the programming exercises that appear near the end of Chapters 1 through 12. Appendix B introduces you to Java's Scripting API along with Java 7's support for dynamically typed languages. Appendix C introduces you to additional APIs and architecture topics. Examples include Accessibility, classloaders, Console, Drag and Drop, Java Native Interface, and System Tray. Appendix D presents a gallery of significant applications that demonstrate various aspects of Java. Unfortunately, there are limits to how much knowledge can be crammed into a print book. For this reason, Appendixes A, B, C, and D are not included in this book's pages. Instead, these appendixes are freely distributed as PDF files. Appendixes A and B are bundled with the book's associated code file at the Apress website (http://www.apress.com/9781430239093).

The lack of portability and interoperability between cloud platforms at different service levels is the main issue affecting cloud-based services today. The brokering, negotiation, management, monitoring and reconfiguration of cloud resources are challenging tasks for developers and users of cloud applications due to the different business models associated with resource consumption, and to the variety of services and features offered by different cloud providers. In chapter 1 the concepts of cloud portability and interoperability are introduced, together with the issues and limitations arising when such features are lacking or ignored. Subsequently, chapter 2 provides an overview of the state-of-the-art methodologies and technologies that are currently used or being explored to enable cloud portability and interoperability. Chapter 3 illustrates the main cross-platform cloud APIs and how they can solve interoperability and portability issues. In turn, chapter 4 presents a set of ready-to-use solutions which, either because of their broad-scale use in cloud computing scenarios or because they utilize established or emerging standards, play a fundamental part in providing interoperable and portable solutions. Lastly, chapter 5 presents an overview of emerging standards for cloud Interoperability and portability. Researchers and developers of cloud-based services will find here a brief survey of the relevant methodologies, APIs and standards, illustrated by case studies and complemented by an extensive reference list for more detailed descriptions of every topic covered.","publisher":"Springer","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vpmiBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":121,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vpmiBwAAQBAJ&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vpmiBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA80&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=91&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781783986118","title":"Android Application Development with Maven","author":"Patroklos Papapetrou, Jonathan LALOU","publish_date":"2015-03-19","description":"Android Application Development with Maven is intended for Android developers or devops engineers who want to use Maven to effectively develop quality Android applications.

Most computer science texts will begin with a section on the history of computers followed with a flurry of definitions that are just \"so many words\" to the average student.

The usual practice of introducing classes and objects is deferred until the student has a firm grasp of the fundamentals (loops, decision structures, etc). Thus, the beginning student is not overwhelmed by the simultaneous introduction of OOPs and the fundamentals.

Vaughn Vernon couples guided approaches to implementation with modern architectures, highlighting the importance and value of focusing on the business domain while balancing technical considerations. Building on Eric Evans' seminal book, Domain-Driven Design, the author presents practical DDD techniques through examples from familiar domains. Each principle is backed up by realistic Java examples–all applicable to C# developers–and all content is tied together by a single case study: the delivery of a large-scale Scrum-based SaaS system for a multitenant environment. The author takes you far beyond “DDD-lite” approaches that embrace DDD solely as a technical toolset, and shows you how to fully leverage DDD's “strategic design patterns” using Bounded Context, Context Maps, and the Ubiquitous Language. Using these techniques and examples, you can reduce time to market and improve quality, as you build software that is more flexible, more scalable, and more tightly aligned to business goals.

It is commonly believed that the computer-based systems most organizations rely on to support their businesses are not very smart. Many of the business decisions these companies make tend to be hidden in systems that make poor decisions, or don't make them at all. Further, most systems aren't configured to learn from the past and therefore struggle to keep up with the pace of change.

Next: choosing source material - whether created you, or from sample CDs like the one attached, or from other people's recordings - which inevitably also raises the thorny subject of copyright and licensing: sampling and the law.Then there's a section depicting the basic layout and operation of some well-known software and hardware samplers, and a look at Sampling & Synthesis and Modular Systems...","publisher":"Hal Leonard Corporation","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_HbhFKzIpDUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":207,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_HbhFKzIpDUC&pg=PA65&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=138&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780879307523","title":"Software Synthesizers: The Definitive Guide to Virtual Musical Instruments","author":"Jim Aikin","publish_date":"2003","description":"Discusses computer programs for making music and current sound synthesis techniques, covering topics including physical modeling, MIDI, and sampled loop libraries.","publisher":"Hal Leonard Corporation","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ipn3e2SLNkUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":290,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ipn3e2SLNkUC&pg=PA46&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=139&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780321617903","title":"Understanding SCA (Service Component Architecture)","author":"Jim Marino, Michael Rowley","publish_date":"2009-06-29","description":"Use SCA to Simplify the Development and Delivery of Service-Based Applications Service Component Architecture (SCA) is a new programming model that enables developers to build distributed applications more efficiently and effectively than previous technologies.

Duvall, Steve Matyas, Andrew Glover","publish_date":"2007-06-29","description":"For any software developer who has spent days in “integration hell,” cobbling together myriad software components, Continuous Integration: Improving Software Quality and Reducing Risk illustrates how to transform integration from a necessary evil into an everyday part of the development process. The key, as the authors show, is to integrate regularly and often using continuous integration (CI) practices and techniques. The authors first examine the concept of CI and its practices from the ground up and then move on to explore other effective processes performed by CI systems, such as database integration, testing, inspection, deployment, and feedback. Through more than forty CI-related practices using application examples in different languages, readers learn that CI leads to more rapid software development, produces deployable software at every step in the development lifecycle, and reduces the time between defect introduction and detection, saving time and lowering costs. With successful implementation of CI, developers reduce risks and repetitive manual processes, and teams receive better project visibility. The book covers How to make integration a “non-event” on your software development projects How to reduce the amount of repetitive processes you perform when building your software Practices and techniques for using CI effectively with your teams Reducing the risks of late defect discovery, low-quality software, lack of visibility, and lack of deployable software Assessments of different CI servers and related tools on the market The book’s companion Web site, www.integratebutton.com, provides updates and code examples.","publisher":"Pearson Education","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PV9qfEdv9L0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":336,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PV9qfEdv9L0C&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":2.5,"ratings_count":11,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PV9qfEdv9L0C&pg=PT45&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=143&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781439816455","title":"Oracle Embedded Programming and Application Development","author":"Lakshman Bulusu","publish_date":"2010-08-03","description":"Focusing on tried and true best practice techniques in cross-technology based Oracle embedded programming, this book provides authoritative guidance for improving your code compilation and execution.

Like most popular technologies, Ant quickly went through a series of early revision cycles. With each new version, more functionality was added, and more complexity was introduced. Ant evolved from a simple-to-learn build tool into a full-fledged testing and deployment environment.Ant: The Definitive Guide has been reworked, revised and expanded upon to reflect this evolution. It documents the new ways that Ant is being applied, as well as the array of optional tasks that Ant supports. In fact, this new second edition covers everything about this extraordinary build management tool from downloading and installing, to using Ant to test code.

A disci pline thus requires knowledge to be acquired which can be applied by practitioners to solve problems within the scope of the discipline. In the case of HCI, such knowledge is being acquired through research and, less formally, through the description of successful system development practice. Some have argued that knowledge is further embodied in the artefacts. HCI knowledge is applied to solve user interface design problems. Such applica tion is facilitated if the knowledge is expressed in a conception which makes explicit the design problems of practitioners. A conception has been proposed by Dowell & Long (1989). The conception provides a framework within which to reason about the implications of designs for system performance. The framework is concordant with the trend towards design, discernible in recent HCI research. It is further compatible with notions of top-down design, fundamental to software engineering practice. 2 Teaching and the HeI Research and Development Gap 2.1 An Assessment of Current HCI Education Teaching is one means by which practitioners learn to specify discipline problems.

The language was object oriented, was compiled into an intermediate form called Java Bytecode, and those bytecode instructions were run on a virtual machine called the Java VM. Java, at the time, was a revolution in itself. It quickly became the language of a new generation of software developers who were writing small applications for the web, server applications for the enterprise, and even desktop applications. Today many new languages compile into Java bytecode and are run on top of the Java VM such as Scala, Groovy and Clojure, as well as variants of Python, Ruby, and Erlang. Java is also the language used to write programs for many of the world's mobile devices, including Android. If you're interested in Android development, there is also a bibliography specific to that platform. Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems in January of 2010 and became the owner of the Java technology. So far, this has not changed how Java has been positioned in the market. Open source software projects have used Java extensively to create some of the world's most popular software libraries. These libraries have likely been one of the driving forces behind the creation of many of the JVM based language ports. Of course, people have to learn about how to use these libraries and languages, so the books written about Java are also varied in nature. There are a great many excellent learning reference books, class library reference books, and books on enterprise and web development. There are books that cover the Java Virtual Machine based languages mentioned earlier. The Spring Framework is a highly popular, open source, modular, infinitely configurable framework written in Java that is also covered well by technical book writers. Many games are written in Java, and we've included a few books on Game programming. If you are writing web services, you'll want to read about Service Oriented Architecture as well as storing and retrieving data using one of the many Java persistence frameworks. This bibliography covers the entire Java language, spanning from introductory to advanced topics. We hope you enjoy them and use them to your advantage.","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1WU-AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":86,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1WU-AAAAQBAJ&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=173&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781783283644","title":"Scala for Java Developers","author":"Thomas Alexandre","publish_date":"2014-04-25","description":"This step-by-step guide is full of easy-to-follow code taken from real-world examples explaining the migration and integration of Scala in a Java project.

Auszug: A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) enables a set of computer software programs and data structures to use a virtual machine model for the execution of other computer programs and scripts. The model used by a JVM accepts a form of computer intermediate language commonly referred to as Java bytecode. This language conceptually represents the instruction set of a stack-oriented, capability architecture. Sun has claimed there are over 4.5 billion JVM-enabled devices. A JVM can also be used to implement programming languages other than Java. For example, Ada source code can be compiled to Java bytecode, which may then be executed by a JVM. JVMs can also be released by other companies...http://booksllc.net/?l=de","publisher":"Books LLC","image_url":null,"total_pages":296,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l-mdcQAACAAJ&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=185&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781586035594","title":"Software Engineering: Evolution and Emerging Technologies","author":"Krzysztof Zieliński, Tomasz Szmuc","publish_date":"2005-01-01","description":"The capability to design quality software and implement modern information systems is at the core of economic growth in the 21st century.

Unit testing in general: Extreme programming approach to unit testing: Parasoft (officially Parasoft Corporation) is an independent software vendor with headquarters in Monrovia, California. It was founded in 1987 by five graduates of the California Institute of Technology who had been working on Caltech Cosmic Cube. The most recent awards received were the Jolt Grand Prize Award for Parasoft Virtualize, Parasoft's service virtualization technology and the Embeddy Award for most cutting edge product for embedded software developers & engineers. Parasoft joined the Eclipse Consortium board of stewards in 2002. Parasoft develops automated defect prevention technologies that support the Automated Defect Prevention methodology developed by Adam Kolawa. These technologies automate a number of defect prevention practices for Java, C and C++, and .NET. The static code analysis practice identifies coding issues that lead to security, reliability, performance, and maintainability issues later on. In 1996, Parasoft submitted a patent application for their rule-based static code analysis. Since then, the original static analysis technology has been extended to include security static analysis, data flow analysis, and software metrics. In 1996, Parasoft submitted patent applications for technology that automatically generates unit test cases. Since then, the original unit testing technology has been extended to include code coverage analysis, regression testing, and traceability. The peer code review practice involves manually inspecting source code to examine algorithms, review design, and search for subtle errors that automated tools cannot detect.

Virtualized approaches can offer important advantages in speed, flexibility, and elasticity. Now, a world-class team of enterprise virtualization and big data experts guide you through the choices, considerations, and tradeoffs surrounding Hadoop virtualization. The authors help you decide whether to virtualize Hadoop, deploy Hadoop in the cloud, or integrate conventional and virtualized approaches in a blended solution. First, Virtualizing Hadoop reviews big data and Hadoop from the standpoint of the virtualization specialist. The authors demystify MapReduce, YARN, and HDFS and guide you through each stage of Hadoop data management. Next, they turn the tables, introducing big data experts to modern virtualization concepts and best practices. Finally, they bring Hadoop and virtualization together, guiding you through the decisions you’ll face in planning, deploying, provisioning, and managing virtualized Hadoop. From security to multitenancy to day-to-day management, you’ll find reliable answers for choosing your best Hadoop strategy and executing it. Coverage includes the following: • Reviewing the frameworks, products, distributions, use cases, and roles associated with Hadoop • Understanding YARN resource management, HDFS storage, and I/O • Designing data ingestion, movement, and organization for modern enterprise data platforms • Defining SQL engine strategies to meet strict SLAs • Considering security, data isolation, and scheduling for multitenant environments • Deploying Hadoop as a service in the cloud • Reviewing the essential concepts, capabilities, and terminology of virtualization • Applying current best practices, guidelines, and key metrics for Hadoop virtualization • Managing multiple Hadoop frameworks and products as one unified system • Virtualizing master and worker nodes to maximize availability and performance • Installing and configuring Linux for a Hadoop environment","publisher":"VMWare Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_PApCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":480,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_PApCgAAQBAJ&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_PApCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=192&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780596551865","title":"The Productive Programmer","author":"Neal Ford","publish_date":"2008-07-03","description":"Anyone who develops software for a living needs a proven way to produce it better, faster, and cheaper.

The book explains all algorithms using actual numeric calculations that you can perform yourself.Artificial Intelligence for Humans is a book series meant to teach AI to those without an extensive mathematical background. The reader needs only a knowledge of basic college algebra or computer programming—anything more complicated than that is thoroughly explained. Every chapter also includes a programming example. Examples are currently provided in Java, C#, R, Python and C. Other languages planned.","publisher":"CreateSpace","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RResngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":222,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RResngEACAAJ&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=195&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781449322489","title":"Resource-Oriented Computing with NetKernel: Taking REST Ideas to the Next Level","author":"Tom Geudens","publish_date":"2012-05-16","description":"Take resource-oriented computing out for a spin with this hands-on introduction to NetKernel, and discover how ROC can improve the way you design and implement software and software systems.

By using NetKernel to create and then string simple services together, you can develop complex systems that scale as easily as the Internet does. Author Tom Geudens helps you create several NetKernel modules right away, and then walks you through the results to demonstrate their effectiveness. Create, test, and document Netkernel modules from scratch Learn the basic principles of ROC’s abstract computing model Design an interface in NetKernel that lets you insert, update, delete, and select actions in MongoDB Use the Visualizer to trace information about root requests processed by NetKernel Handle resource requests with DPML—NetKernel’s Declarative-Request Process Markup Language Compose modular XML documents with the XML Recursion Language (XRL) Build solutions using nCoDE in NetKernel’s visual editor","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2Z3aW-I7dCEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":246,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2Z3aW-I7dCEC&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2Z3aW-I7dCEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=196&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781844807017","title":"Python for Rookies: A First Course in Programming","author":"Sarah Mount, James Shuttleworth, Russel Winder","publish_date":"2008-01-01","description":"Python for Rookies is designed to help students learn how to program. Using the Python language as a tool, the approach taken teaches students the fundamentals of programming and re-enforces good programming practice. Written for students studying a variety of degree subjects such as Games Technology, Creative Computing and Multimedia (where core Computer Science is applied to the Arts) the pace and breadth would also be suitable for a one semester introductory programming course for all computing undergraduates. We hope that the example programs, chosen to enliven and motivate will also be very relevant to a range of courses and the varied ambitions of people who need to acquire programming skills. The book covers programming from small script-style applications to larger pieces of software. The emphasis remains on problem-solving, even through the introduction of common libraries and object-oriented programming. Test-oriented development is an integral part of programming and learning how to incorporate a unit test early on will take away the frustrations of producing buggy software that doesna t run. It will provide a framework to support your learning of programming.","publisher":"Cengage Learning EMEA","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RLU1Gkm1JGoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":454,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":3.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RLU1Gkm1JGoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=groovy,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=197&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781633396333","title":"Introducción A Android Studio.
