This is really quite unfortunate: Java is one of the most widely used programming languages, having many times the number of programmers and programming resources as MATLAB. Also unfortunate is the popular claim that while MATLAB is a fine programming platform for prototyping, it is not suitable for real-world, modern-looking applications. Undocumented Secrets of MATLAB®-Java Programming aims to correct this misconception. This book shows how using Java can significantly improve MATLAB program appearance and functionality, and that this can be done easily and even without any prior Java knowledge. Readers are led step-by-step from simple to complex customizations. Code snippets, screenshots, and numerous online references are provided to enable the utilization of this book as both a sequential tutorial and as a random-access reference suited for immediate use. Java-savvy readers will find it easy to tailor code samples for their particular needs; for Java newcomers, an introduction to Java and numerous online references are provided. This book demonstrates how The MATLAB programming environment relies on Java for numerous tasks, including networking, data-processing algorithms and graphical user-interface (GUI) We can use MATLAB for easy access to external Java functionality, either third-party or user-created Using Java, we can extensively customize the MATLAB environment and application GUI, enabling the creation of visually appealing and usable applications","publisher":"CRC Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ELsZk3Ld2KcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":701,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ELsZk3Ld2KcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=matlab,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=20&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780080922751","title":"Introduction to Pattern Recognition: A Matlab Approach","author":"Sergios Theodoridis, Aggelos Pikrakis, Konstantinos Koutroumbas, Dionisis Cavouras","publish_date":"2010-03-03","description":"An accompanying manual to Theodoridis/Koutroumbas, Pattern Recognition, that includes Matlab code of the most common methods and algorithms in the book, together with a descriptive summary and solved examples, and including real-life data sets in imaging and audio recognition. *Matlab code and descriptive summary of the most common methods and algorithms in Theodoridis/Koutroumbas, Pattern Recognition 4e. *Solved examples in Matlab, including real-life data sets in imaging and audio recognition *Available separately or at a special package price with the main text (ISBN for package: 978-0-12-374491-3)","publisher":"Academic Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9ysEF1OMuycC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":231,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9ysEF1OMuycC&dq=matlab,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9ysEF1OMuycC&printsec=frontcover&dq=matlab,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=21&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781598581812","title":"MATLAB: Advanced GUI Development","author":"Scott T.

The major topics in ordinary differential equations, initial value problems, boundary value problems, and delay differential equations, are usually taught in three separate semester-long courses. This single book provides a sound treatment of all three in fewer than 300 pages. Each chapter begins with a discussion of the 'facts of life' for the problem, mainly by means of examples. Numerical methods for the problem are then developed, but only those methods most widely used. The treatment of each method is brief and technical issues are minimized, but all the issues important in practice and for understanding the codes are discussed. The last part of each chapter is a tutorial that shows how to solve problems by means of small, but realistic, examples.","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P4-9gcpqQ_AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":263,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=P4-9gcpqQ_AC&pg=PA114&dq=matlab,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9783642201431","title":"Robotics, Vision and Control: Fundamental Algorithms in MATLAB","author":"Peter Corke","publish_date":"2011-11-03","description":"The practice of robotics and computer vision both involve the application of computational algorithms to data. Over the fairly recent history of the fields of robotics and computer vision a very large body of algorithms has been developed. However this body of knowledge is something of a barrier for anybody entering the field, or even looking to see if they want to enter the field — What is the right algorithm for a particular problem?, and importantly, How can I try it out without spending days coding and debugging it from the original research papers? The author has maintained two open-source MATLAB Toolboxes for more than 10 years: one for robotics and one for vision. The key strength of the Toolboxes provide a set of tools that allow the user to work with real problems, not trivial examples. For the student the book makes the algorithms accessible, the Toolbox code can be read to gain understanding, and the examples illustrate how it can be used —instant gratification in just a couple of lines of MATLAB code. The code can also be the starting point for new work, for researchers or students, by writing programs based on Toolbox functions, or modifying the Toolbox code itself. The purpose of this book is to expand on the tutorial material provided with the toolboxes, add many more examples, and to weave this into a narrative that covers robotics and computer vision separately and together. The author shows how complex problems can be decomposed and solved using just a few simple lines of code, and hopefully to inspire up and coming researchers. The topics covered are guided by the real problems observed over many years as a practitioner of both robotics and computer vision. It is written in a light but informative style, it is easy to read and absorb, and includes a lot of Matlab examples and figures. The book is a real walk through the fundamentals of robot kinematics, dynamics and joint level control, then camera models, image processing, feature extraction and epipolar geometry, and bring it all together in a visual servo system.

Martinez, Angel Martinez, Jeffrey Solka","publish_date":"2004-11-29","description":"Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conceived at a time when computers were not widely used, and thus computational ability was rather limited. As computational sophistication has increased, EDA has become an even more powerful process for visualizing and summarizing data before making model assumptions to generate hypotheses, encompassing larger and more complex data sets. There are many resources for those interested in the theory of EDA, but this is the first book to use MATLAB to illustrate the computational aspects of this discipline. Exploratory Data Analysis with MATLAB presents the methods of EDA from a computational perspective. The authors extensively use MATLAB code and algorithm descriptions to provide state-of-the-art techniques for finding patterns and structure in data. Addressing theory, they also incorporate many annotated references to direct readers to the more theoretical aspects of the methods. The book presents an approach using the basic functions from MATLAB and the MATLAB Statistics Toolbox, in order to be more accessible and enduring. It also contains pseudo-code to enable users of other software packages to implement the algorithms. This text places the tools needed to implement EDA theory at the fingertips of researchers, applied mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers, and statisticians by using a practical/computational approach.","publisher":"CRC Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=doRV0oXxp6QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":424,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=doRV0oXxp6QC&pg=PA233&dq=matlab,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=30&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780974423999","title":"Signals and Systems with MATLAB Computing and Simulink Modeling","author":"Steven T.

Asundi","publish_date":"2002-12-10","description":"The term \"photomechanics\" describes a suite of experimental techniques which use optics (photo) for studying problems in mechanics. The field has been in existence for some time, but has always lagged behind other experimental and numerical techniques. The main reason for this is that the interpretation of data, which whilst providing whole-field visualization, is not in a form readily amenable to the end-user. Digital image processing has become common within the photomechanics community. However, one approach does not fit all, and subtle variations in technique and method have been developed by different groups working on specific applications. This primer enables the user to get started with their experimental analysis quickly. It is based on the universally popular MATLAB® software, which includes dedicated and optimized functions for a variety of image processing tasks. These can readily scripted, along with the necessary mathematical expressions, for particular experimental techniques. The book provides an introduction to some of the optical techniques, and then introduces MATLAB® routines specific to the image processing in experimental mechanics. There are also case studies on particular techniques. As part of the book, a collection of M-files is provided on CD-ROM, which also contains example images and test code. This provides a starting point for the user, who can then easily add or edit statements or function for their own images. MATLAB® is a registered trademark of The MathWorks, Inc.

As well as showing the reader the growth of technology in this century, the story of AM radio can provide a unique insight into the basics of electrical engineering, making the primary concepts and applications visual and comprehensible. Taking a \"top down\" approach to the subject, Nahin starts with a broad overview of radio as a sociological and technological phenomenon, then describes specific advances in research that made radio possible, moving through deeper levels of technical detail as the story progresses. Readers will see how various concepts and theories are combined to achieve specific practical results. And the book's \"just in time\" method of introducing mathematical and physical theory only as needed to understand a topic, helps readers gain a firm grasp of often elusive material. By focusing specifically on the workings of AM radio, The Science of Radio offers both a fascinating history of radio as an information and entertainment medium and a practical, applications-oriented introduction to electrical engineering.

This book has taken a bold step forward. It not only presents the theory, it reinforces it with simulations, and then it shows us how to actually use the results in real-time applications. This last step is not a trivial step, and that is why so many books, and courses, present only theory and simulations.

Fundamentals of Power Electronics Using MATLAB teaches students and engineers how to use MATLAB as a simulation and computational tool for power electronics.

Each portion of the text starts with an example based on the section material, followed by a detailed solution. A conclusion is then drawn to emphasize the ?point? of the problem and finally an exercise similar to the example is presented to challenge engineer. This format provides an immediate illustration of how to use the material and an opportunity for students to apply the material on their own. The text also introduces sliding mode control (SMC) of converter circuits where the converter is treated as a variable structure system, in addition to traditional pulse-width-modulation (PWM) control. SMC is a relatively new method of control and is a robust and attractive alternative to PWM.

Computation is integral to all modern engineering disciplines, so the better you are at programming, the better you will be in your chosen field. The author departs radically from the typical presentation by teaching concepts and techniques in a rigorous manner rather than listing how to use libraries and functions. He presents pointers in the very first chapter as part of the development of a computational model that facilitates an ab initio presentation of subjects such as function calls, call-by-reference, arrays, the stack, and the heap. The model also allows students to practice the essential skill of memory manipulation throughout the entire course rather than just at the end. As a result, this textbook goes further than is typical for a one-semester course -- abstract data types and linked lists, for example, are covered in depth. The computational model will also serve students in their adventures with programming beyond the course: instead of falling back on rules, they can think through the model to decide how a new programming concept fits with what they already know. The book is appropriate for undergraduate students of engineering and computer science, and graduate students of other disciplines. It contains many exercises integrated into the main text, and the author has made the source code available online.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VK5IjCNA7R8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":238,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VK5IjCNA7R8C&dq=matlab,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VK5IjCNA7R8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=matlab,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=83&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780387989563","title":"Random Signals for Engineers Using MATLAB and Mathcad: Text","author":"Richard C.

Throughout the book, two kinds of proximity information are analyzed: one-mode and two-mode. One-mode proximity data are defined between the objects from a single set and are usually given in the form of a square symmetric matrix; two-mode proximity data are defined between the objects from two distinct sets and are given in the form of a rectangular matrix. In addition, there is typically the flexibility to allow the additive fitting of multiple structures to either the given one- or two-mode proximity information.","publisher":"SIAM","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ViSyUK2jwakC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":214,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ViSyUK2jwakC&printsec=frontcover&dq=matlab,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=88&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9783642975332","title":"Solving Problems in Scientific Computing Using Maple and Matlab®","author":"Walter Gander, Jiri Hrebicek","publish_date":"2012-12-06","description":"Modern computing tools like Maple (symbolic computation) and Matlab (a numeric computation and visualization program) make it possible to easily solve realistic nontrivial problems in scientific computing.

After providing the basic background in electromagnetic theory necessary to utilize the software, the author describes the benefits and many practical uses of the Matlab package. The text demonstrates how Matlab solves basic radiation/scattering antenna problems in structures that range from simple dipoles to patch antennas and patch antenna arrays. Specialized antenna types like fractal antennas and frequency selective surfaces are considered as well. Finally, the text introduces Matlab applications to more advanced problems such as broadband and loaded antennas, UWB pulse antennas, and microstrip antenna arrays.

The goal is not to teach the mathematics of numericalanalysis, but rather to teach the knowledge and skills of solving equationsand presenting them graphically so that readers can easily handle equationsand results of the computations. With its unique and fascinating capabilities, MATLAB has changed theconcept of programming for numerical and mathematical analyses. Therefore, MATLAB is a superb vehicle to achieve our goal. This book fullyimplements the mathematical and graphic tools in the most recent versionof MATLAB. The following four fundamental elements are integrated in this book: (1)programming in MATLAB, (2) mathematical basics of numerical analysis,(3) application of numerical methods to engineering, scientific, and mathematical problems, and (4) scientific graphics with MATLAB. The first two chapters are comprehensive tutorials of MATLAB commands and graphic tools, particularly for the beginner or entry-level collegestudent. Indeed, these two chapters have been most significantly enhancedin this edition compared to the first edition. In Chapter 1, understandingand developing programming skills on MATLAB are emphasized particularlybecause, unless the reader has knowledge and experience with another pro-gramming language, these are tough hurdles for the beginner to overcome.To acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to read the rest of the book,solving the problems at the end of each chapter is very important. Chapter 2 starts out with the elements of graphics on MATLAB, whichis easy to follow. Yet, toward the end of the chapter, three-dimensionalgraphics on the professional level are achieved. Not only is the programmingtechnique of plotting functions mentioned, but also skills of presenting mathematical and scientific material using graphics are developed throughout thechapter. The graphics knowledge acquired in this chapter are foundationsin learning and applying the numerical methods described in the remainderof the book. Again, practice on the computer is important. Some studentstry to memorize scripts without understanding why and how they work,but such an effort is utterly meaningless. More important is to play with afew new commands, understand how they work and how they may fail, andfinally become a master of the commands. Chapters 3 through 11 cover numerical methods and their implementations with MATLAB. All the numerical methods described are illustratedwith applications on MATLAB. Appendices describe special topics, including advanced three-dimensional graphics with colors, motion pictures, imageprocessing, and graphical user interface. Readers should feel free to use thescripts in this book in any way desired. However, the beginning studentsare advised not to u se these scripts blindly. The students should write theirown scripts. Using the lists of the scripts and function, readers can run most examples and figures on their own computers. The m-files of the scripts can bedownloaded as mentioned later. WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT MATLAB? MATLAB may be regarded as a programming language like Fortran or C,although describing it in a few words is difficult. Some of its outstandingfeatures for numerical analyses, however, are: Significantly simpler programming Continuity among integer, real, and complex values Extended range of numbers and their accuracy A comprehensive mathematical library Extensive graphic tools including graphic user interface functions Capability of linking with traditional programming languages Transportability of MATLAB programs An extraordinary feature of MATLAB is that there is no distinction amongreal, complex, and integer numbers. All numbers are in double precision. InMATLAB, all kinds of numbers are continuously connected, as they should be. It means that in MATLAB, any variable can take any type of numberwithout special declaration in programming. This makes programming fasterand more productive. In Fortran, a different subroutine is necessary for eachsingle, double, real or complex, or integer variable, while in MATLAB thereis no need to separate them. The mathematical library in MATLAB makes mathematical analyseseasy. Yet the user can develop additional mathematical routines significantlymore easily than in other programming languages because of the continuitybetween real and complex variables. Among numerous mathematical functions, linear algebra solvers play central roles. Indeed, the whole MATLABsystem is founded upon linear algebra solvers. IMPORTANCE OF GRAPHICS Graphic presentation of mathematical analysis helps the reader to under-stand mathematics and makes it enjoyable. Although this advantage hasbeen well known, presenting computed results with computer graphics wasnot without substantial extra effort in the past. With MATLAB, however,graphic presentations of mathematical material is possible with just a fewcommands. Scientific and even artistic graphic objects can be created on thescreen using mathematical expressions. It has been found that MATLABgraphics motivate and excite students to learn mathematical and numericalmethods that could otherwise be dull. MATLAB graphics are easy and great fun for readers. This book alsoillustrates image processing and production of motion pictures for scientific computing as well as for artistic or hobby material. WILL MATLAB ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR FORTRAN OR C? The answer is no. Fortran and C are still important for high-performancecomputing that requires a large memory or long computing time. The speedof MATLAB computation is significantly slower than that with Fortran orC because MATLAB is paying the high price for the nice features. Learn-ing Fortran or C, however, is not a prerequisite for understanding MATLAB. REFERENCE BOOKS THAT ARE HELPFUL TO LEARN MATLAB This book explains many MATLAB commands but is not intended to be acomplete guide to MATLAB. Readers interested in further information onMATLAB are advised to read User's Guide and Reference Guide. Also, youshould know that over 400 books for use with MATLAB, Simulink, Tool-boxes, and Blocksets have been written.

Based on the author’s belief that only \"hands-on\" experience with the material can promote intuitive understanding, the approach is to motivate the need for theory using MATLAB examples, followed by theory and analysis, and finally descriptions of \"real-world\" examples to acquaint the reader with a wide variety of applications. The latter is intended to answer the usual question \"Why do we have to study this?\" Other salient features are: *heavy reliance on computer simulation for illustration and student exercises *the incorporation of MATLAB programs and code segments *discussion of discrete random variables followed by continuous random variables to minimize confusion *summary sections at the beginning of each chapter *in-line equation explanations *warnings on common errors and pitfalls *over 750 problems designed to help the reader assimilate and extend the concepts Intuitive Probability and Random Processes using MATLAB® is intended for undergraduate and first-year graduate students in engineering.

However, a solid understanding of fuzzy processing requires a firm grasp of essential principles and background knowledge. Fuzzy Image Processing and Applications with MATLAB® presents the integral science and essential mathematics behind this exciting and dynamic branch of image processing, which is becoming increasingly important to applications in areas such as remote sensing, medical imaging, and video surveillance, to name a few. Many texts cover the use of crisp sets, but this book stands apart by exploring the explosion of interest and significant growth in fuzzy set image processing. The distinguished authors clearly lay out theoretical concepts and applications of fuzzy set theory and their impact on areas such as enhancement, segmentation, filtering, edge detection, content-based image retrieval, pattern recognition, and clustering. They describe all components of fuzzy, detailing preprocessing, threshold detection, and match-based segmentation. Minimize Processing Errors Using Dynamic Fuzzy Set Theory This book serves as a primer on MATLAB and demonstrates how to implement it in fuzzy image processing methods. It illustrates how the code can be used to improve calculations that help prevent or deal with imprecision—whether it is in the grey level of the image, geometry of an object, definition of an object’s edges or boundaries, or in knowledge representation, object recognition, or image interpretation. The text addresses these considerations by applying fuzzy set theory to image thresholding, segmentation, edge detection, enhancement, clustering, color retrieval, clustering in pattern recognition, and other image processing operations. Highlighting key ideas, the authors present the experimental results of their own new fuzzy approaches and those suggested by different authors, offering data and insights that will be useful to teachers, scientists, and engineers, among others.","publisher":"CRC Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gWjMBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":237,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gWjMBQAAQBAJ&dq=matlab,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gWjMBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA185&dq=matlab,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=123&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9783662435113","title":"Exercises in Computational Mathematics with MATLAB","author":"Tom Lyche, Jean-Louis Merrien","publish_date":"2014-09-02","description":"Designed to provide tools for independent study, this book contains student-tested mathematical exercises joined with MATLAB programming exercises.

It demonstrates how the built-in functions of MATLAB can be used to solve systems of linear equations, ODEs, roots of transcendental equations, statistical problems, optimization problems, control systems problems, and stress analysis problems. These built-in functions are essentially black boxes to students. By combining MATLAB with basic numerical and analytical techniques, the mystery of what these black boxes might contain is somewhat alleviated. This classroom-tested text first reviews the essentials involved in writing computer programs as well as fundamental aspects of MATLAB. It next explains how matrices can solve problems of linear equations, how to obtain the roots of algebraic and transcendental equations, how to evaluate integrals, and how to solve various ODEs. After exploring the features of Simulink, the book discusses curve fitting, optimization problems, and PDE problems, such as the vibrating string, unsteady heat conduction, and sound waves. The focus then shifts to the solution of engineering problems via iteration procedures, differential equations via Laplace transforms, and stress analysis problems via the finite element method. The final chapter examines control systems theory, including the design of single-input single-output (SISO) systems.

Today we simulate tens of thousands of particles in real-time on a single cpu – even in a browser plugin – and advanced particle systems have become common practice for the simulation of snow, rain, dust, smoke, fire, and explosions in most computer games. Modern simulation environments like Processing can be used to produce such astonishingly addicting games as Falling Sand Game, sodaplay, BallDroppings, and Souptoys. In 2006, Traer Bernstein wrote a pretty impressing particle physics library for Processing, which actually was the inspiration for this particle system toolbox in Matlab. As a matter of fact, object oriented programming in Matlab is not really the fastest lane on the particle system highway; we are back at the good old days of some ten or twenty real-time particles. But – the main purpose of this toolbox has never been to develop state-of-the-art computer games; it was rather planned as an educational, interactive learning-by-doing playground, with the aim to understand the mechanical interactions (and maybe the mathematical background) of the particle system components.

This often demands that MATLAB codes run faster by leveraging the distributed parallelism of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). While MATLAB successfully provides high-level functions as a simulation tool for rapid prototyping, the underlying details and knowledge needed for utilizing GPUs make MATLAB users hesitate to step into it. Accelerating MATLAB with GPUs offers a primer on bridging this gap. Starting with the basics, setting up MATLAB for CUDA (in Windows, Linux and Mac OS X) and profiling, it then guides users through advanced topics such as CUDA libraries. The authors share their experience developing algorithms using MATLAB, C++ and GPUs for huge datasets, modifying MATLAB codes to better utilize the computational power of GPUs, and integrating them into commercial software products.

Encompassing a diverse mathematical core, Elements of Matrix Modeling and Computing with MATLAB examines a variety of applications and their modeling processes, showing you how to develop matrix models and solve algebraic systems. Emphasizing practical skills, it creates a bridge from problems with two and three variables to more realistic problems that have additional variables. Elements of Matrix Modeling and Computing with MATLAB focuses on seven basic applications: circuits, trusses, mixing tanks, heat conduction, data modeling, motion of a mass, and image filters. These applications are developed from very simple to more complex models. To explain the processes, the book explores numerous topics in linear algebra, including complex numbers and functions, matrices, algebraic systems, curve fitting, elements of linear differential equations, transform methods, and tools of computation. For example, the author uses linearly independent vectors and subspaces to explain over- and under-determined systems, eigenvalues and eigenvectors to solve initial value problems, and discrete Fourier transforms to perform image filtering in the frequency domain. Although the primary focus is to cultivate calculation skills by hand, most chapters also include MATLAB to help with more complicated calculations.","publisher":"CRC Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gOk9ioNz3wIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":402,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gOk9ioNz3wIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=matlab,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=158&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9783662058046","title":"Applied Statistics Using SPSS, STATISTICA and MATLAB","author":"Joaquim P.

The FEM has become the leading method in computer–oriented mechanics, so that many scienti?c brancheshavegrownup besides overthelastdecades. Nevertheless,theFEM today is a question of economy. On the one hand its industrial application is forced to reduce product development costs and time, on the other hand a large number of commercial FEM codes and a still growing number of software for e?ective pre– and postprocessors are available in the meantime. Due to that, today it is a quite challenging task to operate with all these di?erent tools at the same time and to understand all handling and so- tion techniques developed over the last years. So, we want to help in getting a deeper insight into the main “interfaces” between the “customers of the FEM” and the codes itself by providing a totally open structured FE–code based on Matlab, which is a very powerful tool in operating with matrix based formulations. That idea and conditions forced us some years ago to initiateDAEdalon as a tool for general FE developments in research appli- tions. In spite of still existing high sophisticated – mostly commercial – FE codes, the success and the acceptance of such a structured tool justify that decision afterwards more and more.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EyD21uTbvekC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":64,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EyD21uTbvekC&dq=matlab,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EyD21uTbvekC&printsec=frontcover&dq=matlab,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=160&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781420043051","title":"Signal Processing for Intelligent Sensor Systems with MATLAB, Second Edition","author":"David C.

The aim is to have an interactive MATLAB script wherein the user can vary parameters in a specific problem and then immediately see the outcome by way of dynamic “movies” of the response of the system in question. MATLAB tools are used throughout and the software scripts accompany the text in Symbolic Mathematics, Classical Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Waves and Optics, Gases and Fluid Flow, Quantum Mechanics, Special and General Relativity, and Astrophysics and Cosmology. The emphasis is on building up an intuition by running many different parametric choices chosen actively by the user and watching the subsequent behavior of the system. Physics books using MATLAB do not have the range — or the intent — of this text. They are rather steeped in technical detail.

The 16 experiments are grouped in four main topic areas: sampling and digital-to-analog (D/A) conversion; the discrete-time Fourier transform; gain and phase-shift studies of digital filters; and analog-to-digital (A/D) quantization. (See TOC below for a listing of specific lab experiments.) The goal of these experiments is to enable students to understand the full physical significance of key concepts through a deeper understanding of the underlying mathematical formulas - not to teach MATLAB®. In each experiment, students enter problem parameter values, plot the results using MATLAB®'s powerful plotting functions, and then respond to questions in the manual that require them to analyze and interpret these results. The experiments challenge students to approach the study of these topics in the role of an experimental investigator; students are required to define the quantitative values and size properties of each design criterion in a problem. As a result, students develop an appreciation of the physical meaning of the derived results, their theoretical and physical implications, and the use of the scientific method.","publisher":"Brooks/Cole Pub Co","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YGdTAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":119,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YGdTAAAAMAAJ&q=matlab,+subject:computers&dq=matlab,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=180&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780898716917","title":"Insight Through Computing: A MATLAB Introduction to Computational Science and Engineering","author":"Charles F.

Grigoryan, Merughan M. Grigoryan","publish_date":"2012-10-15","description":"Focusing on mathematical methods in computer tomography, Image Processing: Tensor Transform and Discrete Tomography with MATLAB® introduces novel approaches to help in solving the problem of image reconstruction on the Cartesian lattice. Specifically, it discusses methods of image processing along parallel rays to more quickly and accurately reconstruct images from a finite number of projections, thereby avoiding overradiation of the body during a computed tomography (CT) scan. The book presents several new ideas, concepts, and methods, many of which have not been published elsewhere. New concepts include methods of transferring the geometry of rays from the plane to the Cartesian lattice, the point map of projections, the particle and its field function, and the statistical model of averaging. The authors supply numerous examples, MATLAB®-based programs, end-of-chapter problems, and experimental results of implementation. The main approach for image reconstruction proposed by the authors differs from existing methods of back-projection, iterative reconstruction, and Fourier and Radon filtering. In this book, the authors explain how to process each projection by a system of linear equations, or linear convolutions, to calculate the corresponding part of the 2-D tensor or paired transform of the discrete image. They then describe how to calculate the inverse transform to obtain the reconstruction. The proposed models for image reconstruction from projections are simple and result in more accurate reconstructions. Introducing a new theory and methods of image reconstruction, this book provides a solid grounding for those interested in further research and in obtaining new results. It encourages readers to develop effective applications of these methods in CT.","publisher":"CRC Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xDrSBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":466,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xDrSBQAAQBAJ&dq=matlab,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xDrSBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=matlab,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=210&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781484205594","title":"MATLAB Recipes: A Problem-Solution Approach","author":"Michael Paluszek, Stephanie Thomas","publish_date":"2015-11-23","description":"Learn from state-of-the-art examples in robotics, motors, detection filters, chemical processes, aircraft, and spacecraft.

Multi-Carrier Communication Systems with Examples in MATLAB®: A New Perspective addresses the two primary drawbacks of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication systems: the high sensitivity to carrier frequency offsets and phase noise, and the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the transmitted signals. Presenting a new interleaving scheme for multicarrier communication, the book starts with a detailed overview of multi-carrier systems such as OFDM, multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA), and single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems. From there, it proposes a new way to deal with the frequency-selective fading channel: the single-carrier with frequency domain equalization (SC-FDE) scheme. The second part of the book examines the performance of the continuous phase modulation (CPM)-based OFDM (CPM-OFDM) system. It proposes a CPM-based single-carrier frequency domain equalization (CPM-SC-FDE) structure for broadband wireless communication systems. In the third part of the book, the author proposes a chaotic interleaving scheme for both CPM-OFDM and the CPM-SC-FDE systems. A comparison between the proposed chaotic interleaving and the conventional block interleaving is also performed in this part. The final part of the book presents efficient image transmission techniques over multi-carrier systems such as OFDM, MC-CDMA, and SC-FDMA. It details a new approach for efficient image transmission over OFDM and MC-CDMA systems using chaotic interleaving that transmits images over wireless channels efficiently. The book studies the performance of discrete cosine transform-based single-carrier frequency division multiple access (DCT-SC-FDMA) with image transmission. It also proposes a CPM-based DCT-SC-FDMA structure for efficient image transmission. The book includes MATLAB® simulations along with MATLAB code so you can practice carrying out your own extensive simulations.","publisher":"CRC Press","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=i-OYCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":284,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i-OYCgAAQBAJ&dq=matlab,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i-OYCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=matlab,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=218&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9789812568731","title":"Engineering Optics with Matlab","author":"Ting-Chung Poon, Taegeun Kim","publish_date":"2006-01-01","description":"This invaluable textbook serves two purposes.

Biran","publish_date":"2010-07-20","description":"MATLAB® can be used to execute many mathematical and engineering calculations, as well as a handheld computer can—if not better. Moreover, like many other computer languages, it can perform tasks that a handheld computer cannot. Compared to other computer languages, MATLAB provides many built-in functions that make learning easier and reduce prototyping time. Simulink® is a toolbox that extends the possibilities of MATLAB by providing a graphical interface for modeling and simulating dynamical processes. Using examples from mathematics, mechanical and electrical engineering, and control and signal processing, What Every Engineer Should Know About MATLAB® and Simulink® provides an introduction to these two computer environments and examines the advantages and limitations of MATLAB. It first explores the benefits of how to use MATLAB to solve problems and then process and present calculations and experimental results. This book also briefly introduces the reader to more advanced features of the software, such as object-oriented programming (OOP), and it draws the attention to some specialized toolboxes. Key features of the book include demonstrations of how to: Visualize the results of calculations in various kinds of graphical representations Write useful script files and functions for solving specific problems Avoid disastrous computational errors Convert calculations into technical reports and insert calculations and graphs into either MS Word or LaTeX This book illustrates the limitations of the computer, as well as the implications associated with errors that can result from approximations or numerical errors. Using selected examples of computer-aided errors, the author explains that the set of computer numbers is discrete and bounded—a feature that can cause catastrophic errors if not properly taken into account. In conjunction with The Mathworks—marketers of MATLAB and Simulink—a supplementary website is presented to offer access to software implemented in the book and the script files used to produce the figures.

To help rebuilding a system properly, there exist formalistic descriptions of systems behavior. One of several system specification formalisms, the DEVS formalism and associated abstract simulator algorithms provide the bases of this work. The DEVS formalism offers ways to describe systems which change their state driven by events at discrete times. Several implementations for computer aided simulation based on the DEVS formalism and associated abstract simulator concepts using object-orientated programming languages exist. One of those implementations, the MatlabDEVS simulation runtime system was modified and improved during this project and MatlabDEVS2, a modified version was developed. To make improvement possible, a proper understanding of the fundamental theories is indispensable. Hence, they are exhibited as a part of this work. Because the modeler should be supported by the computer application while passing the process of modeling and simulation, the user interfaces are crucial for the quality of the system. The existing MatlabDEVS system did not offer any support for modeling and simulation, as well as it was not well documented. Object orientated programming within the MATLAB® programming environment results in a complicated file structure representing the classes. This fact cannot be influenced. Hence, a GUI for modeling and simulation which creates the source code files for the classes was implemented. The DEVS (Discrete Event Systems Specification) formalism introduced and developed by Zeigler is a formalistic way of describing systems which are subjects to event-driven changes of system states. An example for such a system could be any kind of sales office where something happens, if a customer arrives at the shop. The system then changes state, which means that the salesman is busy, or if he was already, the waiting queue grows. After a given time the customer is served and the system changes state again. Characteristically, the time base for such a system is continuous, this means a customer could arrive at any time not just at discrete times. The DEVS formalism and associated simulator concepts have been implemented for simulation means in different ways using several object-orientated programming languages. To gain acquaintance of this field, first the general rules for modeling and simulation have to be exposed. Then an overview over system specification formalism is given and the DEVS formalism needs to be explained detailed. Because the DEVS formalism includes a modular hierarchical concept, it fits well with the object-orientated programming paradigm and implementation with an object-orientated programming language is obvious. The analysis of the MatlabDEVS simulation runtime system, which acts as starting-point, begins with the characterization of the object-orientated features of the MATLAB® programming language. The object-orientated programming within the MATLAB® environment differs quite a lot from object-orientated programming using for example C++, Java or Object Pascal. Then MatlabDEVS, a simulation runtime system developed by Prof. T. Pawletta in 1998 and advanced as a diploma at the Wismar University of Technology, Business and Design and the Tomsk Polytechnic University by Issaev Artem in 2002, is explained and tested. The MatlabDEVS system is realized with the MATLAB® programming language and uses class definitions for both, model building and simulation. MatlabDEVS implements the entire DEVS formalism well, but caused by MATLAB® s way of defining classes, a complicated, hard to follow up file structure is needed to build models. This is the biggest disadvantage of MatlabDEVS: The modeler has to keep track of many source code files and may easily loose perspective. The next step is to give prospects for further improvement of the system. Especially the user interfaces for modeling and simulation are of interest, because they are crucial for the quality of the system. Those prospects did lead to the development of the MatlabDEVS2 system, which includes some smaller changes in the simulation engine as well as a graphical user interface (GUI) for modeling and simulation. The GUI is implemented taking benefit of MATLAB® s facilities for creating graphical user interfaces. Since it is impossible to avoid models complicated file structure, the user interface for modeling offers support to create and administer those files in a clearly arranged way. System requirements, structure and facilities of MatlabDEVS2 are presented and described. A user guide for MatlabDEVS2 can be found in appendix. The last step in this project is the verification of the MatlabDEVS2 system using the Bank Simulation example taken from the diploma of Issaev Artem. This model represents the flow of customers in a bank. It consists of a waiting queue, two counters to serve the customers and the experimental frame which generates the customers and computes statistics of system s behavior.

Signals that the RTL-SDR hardware can receive include: FM radio, UHF band signals, ISM signals, GSM, 3G and LTE mobile radio, GPS and satellite signals, and any that the reader can (legally) transmit of course! In this book we introduce readers to SDR methods by viewing and analysing downconverted RF signals in the time and frequency domains, and then provide extensive DSP enabled SDR design exercises which the reader can learn from. The hands-on SDR design examples begin with simple AM and FM receivers, and move on to the more challenging aspects of PHY layer DSP, where receive filter chains, real-time channelisers, and advanced concepts such as carrier synchronisers, digital PLL designs and QPSK timing and phase synchronisers are implemented. In the book we will also show how the RTL-SDR can be used with SDR transmitters to develop complete communication systems, capable of transmitting payloads such as simple text strings, images and audio across the lab desktop.","publisher":null,"image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iHMsjgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":672,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iHMsjgEACAAJ&dq=matlab,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=244&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780080534978","title":"Introduction to the Modelling of Marine Ecosystems: (with MATLAB programs on accompanying CD-ROM)","author":"W.

The face location calculation included shade based skin division and picture separating. The face area was dictated by figuring the centroid of the discovered locale. A product variant of the calculation was autonomously executed and tried on still pictures in MATLAB. Despite the fact that the move from MATLAB to verilog was not as smooth obviously, trial results demonstrated the exactness and viability of the constant framework, much under shifting states of lights, facial postures and skin colors, All estimation of the fittings usage was carried out continuously with negligible computational exertion consequently suitable for force constrained provisions.","publisher":"GRIN Verlag","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NlniAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":10,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NlniAwAAQBAJ&dq=matlab,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NlniAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=matlab,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=263&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780534371715","title":"Automatic Control: The Power of Feedback Using MATLAB","author":"Theodore Euclid Djaferis","publish_date":"2000","description":"This unique, brief, interdisciplinary text uses the concept of automatic control as a unifying idea to explain the field of engineering - and the kinds of problems engineers solve - to first-year students.

The RTL-SDR can be used to acquire and sample RF (radio frequency) signals transmitted in the frequency range 25MHz to 1.75GHz, and the MATLAB and Simulink environment can be used to develop receivers using first principles DSP (digital signal processing) algorithms. Signals that the RTL-SDR hardware can receive include: FM radio, UHF band signals, ISM signals, GSM, 3G and LTE mobile radio, GPS and satellite signals, and any that the reader can (legally) transmit of course! In this book we introduce readers to SDR methods by viewing and analysing downconverted RF signals in the time and frequency domains, and then provide extensive DSP enabled SDR design exercises which the reader can learn from. The hands-on SDR design examples begin with simple AM and FM receivers, and move on to the more challenging aspects of PHY layer DSP, where receive filter chains, real-time channelisers, and advanced concepts such as carrier synchronisers, digital PLL designs and QPSK timing and phase synchronisers are implemented. In the book we will also show how the RTL-SDR can be used with SDR transmitters to develop complete communication systems, capable of transmitting payloads such as simple text strings, images and audio across the lab desktop.","publisher":null,"image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iHMsjgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&source=gbs_api","total_pages":672,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":null,"average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iHMsjgEACAAJ&dq=matlab,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=269&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780080534978","title":"Introduction to the Modelling of Marine Ecosystems: (with MATLAB programs on accompanying CD-ROM)","author":"W.

In the AD tools arena new implementations are introduced covering, for example, Java and graphical modeling environments or join the set of existing tools for Fortran. New developments in AD algorithms target the efficiency of matrix-operation derivatives, detection and exploitation of sparsity, partial separability, the treatment of nonsmooth functions, and other high-level mathematical aspects of the numerical computations to be differentiated. Applications stem from the Earth sciences, nuclear engineering, fluid dynamics, and chemistry, to name just a few. In many cases the applications in a given area of science or engineering share characteristics that require specific approaches to enable AD capabilities or provide an opportunity for efficiency gains in the derivative computation.

Downey","publish_date":"2009-03-20","description":"The Little Book of Semaphores is a textbook that introduces the principles of synchronization for concurrent programming. In most computer science curricula, synchronization is a module in an Operating Systems class. OS textbooks present a standard set of problems with a standard set of solutions, but most students don't get a good understanding of the material or the ability to solve similar problems. The approach of this book is to identify patterns that are useful for a variety of synchronization problems and then show how they can be assembled into solutions. After each problem, the book offers a hint before showing a solution, giving students a better chance of discovering solutions on their own. The book covers the classical problems, including \"Readers-writers,\" \"Producer-consumer,\" and \"Dining Philosophers.\" In addition, it collects a number of not-so-classical problems. *** Published under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License.

As a foundation, the authors present a comprehensive guide to the necessary fundamentals of functional analysis and variational calculus, as well as splines.

Here, we propose a local variation detection and restoration method based on the two-dimensional (2D) principal component analysis (PCA). The depth map of a 3D facial image is first smoothed using median filter to minimize the local variation. The detected face shape is cropped & normalized to a standard image size of 101x101 pixels and the forefront nose point is selected to be the image center. Facial depthvalues are scaled between 0 and 255 for translation and scaling-invariant identification. The preprocessed face image is smoothed to minimize the local variations. The 2DPCA is applied to the resultant range data and the corresponding principal-(or eigen-) images are used as the characteristic feature vectors of the subject to find his/her identity in the database of pre-recorded faces. The system's performance is tested against the GavabDB facial databases. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to identify subjects with different gesture and mimics in the presence of noise in their 3D facial image.","publisher":"GRIN Verlag","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jCeL_gNvA2YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":5,"written_language":"en","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jCeL_gNvA2YC&dq=matlab,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":null,"ratings_count":null,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jCeL_gNvA2YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=matlab,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=284&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9781439822890","title":"Real Life Applications of Soft Computing","author":"Anupam Shukla, Ritu Tiwari, Rahul Kala","publish_date":"2010-05-21","description":"Rapid advancements in the application of soft computing tools and techniques have proven valuable in the development of highly scalable systems and resulted in brilliant applications, including those in biometric identification, interactive voice response systems, and data mining. Although many resources on the subject adequately cover the theoretic concepts, few provide clear insight into practical application. Filling this need, Real Life Applications of Soft Computing explains such applications, including the underlying technology and its implementation. While these systems initially seem complex, the authors clearly demonstrate how they can be modeled, designed, and implemented. Written in a manner that makes it accessible to novices, the book begins by covering the theoretical foundations of soft computing. It supplies a concise explanation of various models, principles, algorithms, tools, and techniques, including artificial neural networks, fuzzy systems, evolutionary algorithms, and hybrid algorithms. Supplying in-depth exposure to real life systems, the text provides: Multi-dimensional coverage supported by references, figures, and tables Warnings about common pitfalls in the implementation process, as well as detailed examinations of possible solutions A timely account of developments in various areas of application Solved examples and exercises in each chapter Detailing a wide range of contemporary applications, the text includes coverage of those in biometric systems, including physiological and behavioral biometrics. It also examines applications in legal threat assessment, robotic path planning, and navigation control. The authors consider fusion methods in biometrics and bioinformatics and also provide effective disease identification techniques. Complete with algorithms for robotic path planning, the book addresses character recognition and presents the picture compression technique by using a customized hybrid algorithm.

Los autores muestran cómo calcular los ceros o las integrales de funciones continuas, resolver sistemas lineales, aproximar funciones por polinomios y construir aproximaciones precisas para la solución de ecuaciones diferenciales. Para hacer la presentación concreta y atractiva, se ha adoptado el entorno de programación MATLAB como un fiel compañero. Se muestran todos los algoritmos introducidos a través del libro, suministrando de este modo una evaluación cuantitativa inmediata de sus propiedades teóricas como son la estabilidad, la precisión y la complejidad. El libro también contiene la solución de varios problemas planteados a través de ejercicios y ejemplos, a menudo surgidos de aplicaciones específicas. Se dedica una sección específica a temas que no fueron tratados en el libro y se indican algunas referencias bibliográficas para un tratamiento más completo de la materia.","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Vfo-S7Fj7i4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=none&source=gbs_api","total_pages":329,"written_language":"es","asin":0,"reviews":"tbd","price":1,"similar_items":"tbd","sale_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Vfo-S7Fj7i4C&dq=matlab,+subject:computers&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":1,"preview_url":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Vfo-S7Fj7i4C&pg=PA127&dq=matlab,+subject:computers&hl=&cd=289&source=gbs_api","sales_rank":3},{"isbn":"9780133114065","title":"Engineering Design Graphics With Solidworks 2011 + Matlab","author":"James Bethune","publish_date":"2012-08-01","description":"Engineering Design and Graphics with SolidWorks 2011 shows students how to use SolidWorks to create engineering drawings and designs.
